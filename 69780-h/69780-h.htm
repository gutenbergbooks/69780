  <h2 class='c005'>MRS. HALLAM’S COMPANION.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>THE HALLAMS.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Carter Hallam was going to Europe,—going
to Aix-les Bains,—partly for the baths, which she hoped
“would lessen her fast-increasing avoirdupois, and partly
to join her intimate friend, Mrs. Walker Haynes, who
had urged her coming and had promised to introduce
her to some of the best people, both English and American.
This attracted Mrs. Hallam more than the baths.
She was anxious to know the best people, and she did
know a good many, although her name was not in the
list of the four hundred. But she meant it should be
there in the near future, nor did it seem unlikely that it
might be. There was not so great a distance between the
four hundred and herself, as she was now, as there had
been between Mrs. Carter Hallam and little Lucy Brown,
who used to live with her grandmother in an old yellow
house in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, and pick berries to
buy herself a pair of morocco boots. Later on, when
the grandmother was dead and the yellow house
sold, Lucy had worked first in a shoe-shop and then in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a dry-goods store in Worcester, where, attracted by her
handsome face, Carter Hallam, a thriving grocer, had
made her his wife and mistress of a pretty little house
on the west side of the city. As a clerk she had often
waited upon the West Side ladies, whom she admired
greatly, fancying she could readily distinguish them
from the ladies of the East Side. To marry a Hallam
was a great honor, but to be a West-Sider was a greater,
and when both came to her she nearly lost her balance,
although her home was far removed from the aristocratic
quarters where the old families, the real West-Siders,
lived. In a way she was one of them, she
thought, or at least she was no longer a clerk, and she
began to cut her old acquaintances, while her husband
laughed at and ridiculed her, wondering what difference
it made whether one lived on the east or west side of a
town. He did not care whether people took him for a
nabob, or a fresh importation from the wild and woolly
West; he was just Carter Hallam, a jolly, easy-going
fellow whom everybody knew and everybody liked.
He was born on a farm in Leicester, where the Hallams,
although comparatively poor, were held in high esteem
as one of the best and oldest families. At twenty-one
he came into the possession of a few thousand dollars
left him by an uncle for whom he was named, and then
he went to the Far West, roughing it with cowboys and
ranchmen, and investing his money in a gold-mine in
Montana and in lands still farther west. Then he returned
to Worcester, bought a small grocery, married
Lucy Brown, and lived quietly for a few years, when
suddenly one day there flashed across the wires the
news that his mine had proved one of the richest in
Montana, and his lands were worth many times what he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>gave for them. He was a millionaire, with property
constantly rising in value, and Worcester could no
longer hold his ambitious wife.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was too small a place for her, she said, for everybody
knew everybody else’s business and history, and,
no matter how much she was worth, somebody was sure
to taunt her with having worked in a shoe-shop, if,
indeed, she did not hear that she had once picked berries
to buy herself some shoes. They must go away
from the old life, if they wanted to be anybody. They
must travel and see the world, and get cultivated, and
know what to talk about with their equals.</p>

<p class='c012'>So they sold the house and the grocery and traveled
east and west, north and south, and finally went to Europe,
where they stayed two or three years, seeing nearly
everything there was to be seen, and learning a great
deal about ruins and statuary and pictures, in which
Mrs. Hallam thought herself a connoisseur, although
she occasionally got the Sistine Chapel and the Sistine
Madonna badly mixed, and talked of the Paul Belvedere,
a copy of which she bought at an enormous price.
When they returned to America Mr. Hallam was a
three times millionaire, for all his speculations had been
successful and his mine was still yielding its annual
harvest of gold. A handsome house on Fifth Avenue
in New York was bought and furnished in the most approved
style, and then Mrs. Hallam began to consider
the best means of getting into society. She already
knew a good many New York people whom she had
met abroad, and whose acquaintance it was desirable to
continue. But she soon found that acquaintances made
in Paris or Rome or on the Nile were not as cordial
when met at home, and she was beginning to feel discouraged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>when chance threw in her way Mrs. Walker
Haynes, who, with the bluest of blood and the
smallest of purses, knew nearly every one worth knowing,
and, it was hinted, would for a <i><span lang="la">quid pro quo</span></i> open
many fashionable doors to aspiring applicants who,
without her aid, would probably stay outside forever.</p>

<p class='c012'>The daughter and grand-daughter and cousin of governors
and senators and judges, with a quiet assumption
of superiority which was seldom offensive to those
whom she wished to conciliate, she was a power in society,
and more quoted and courted than any woman in
her set. To be noticed by Mrs. Walker Haynes was
usually a guarantee of success, and Mrs. Hallam was
greatly surprised when one morning a handsome coupé
stopped before her door and a moment after her maid
brought her Mrs. Walker Haynes’s card. She knew all
about Mrs. Walker Haynes and what she was capable
of doing, and in a flutter of excitement she went down
to meet her. Mrs. Walker Haynes, who never took
people up if there was anything doubtful in their antecedents,
knew all about Mrs. Hallam, even to the shoe-shop
and the clerkship. But she knew, too, that she
was perfectly respectable, with no taint whatever upon
her character, and that she was anxious to get into society.
As it chanced, Mrs. Haynes’s funds were low,
for business was dull, as there were fewer human moths
than usual hovering around the social candle, and when
the ladies of the church which both she and Mrs. Hallam
attended met to devise ways and means for raising
money for some new charity, she spoke of Mrs. Hallam
and offered to call upon her for a subscription, if the
ladies wished it. They did wish it, and the next day
found Mrs. Haynes waiting in Mrs. Hallam’s drawing-room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>for the appearance of its mistress, her quick-seeing
eyes taking in every detail in its furnishing, and
deciding on the whole that it was very good.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some one has taste,—the upholsterer and decorator,
probably,” she thought, as Mrs. Hallam came in, nervous
and flurried, but at once put at ease by her visitor’s
gracious and friendly manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a few general topics and the mention of a
mutual friend whom Mrs. Hallam had met in Cairo,
Mrs. Haynes came directly to the object of her visit,
apologizing first for the liberty she was taking, and
adding:</p>

<p class='c012'>“But now that you are one of us in the church, I
thought you might like to help us, and we need it so
much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Hallam was not naturally generous where nothing
was to be gained, but Mrs. Haynes’s manner, and
her “now you are one of us,” made her so in this instance,
and taking the paper she wrote her name for
two hundred dollars, which was nearly one-fourth of the
desired sum. There was a gleam of humor as well as
of surprise in Mrs. Haynes’s eyes as she read the amount,
but she was profuse in her thanks and expressions of
gratitude, and, promising to call very soon socially, she
took her leave with a feeling that it would pay to take
up Mrs. Hallam, who was really more lady-like and
better educated than many whom she had launched
upon the sea of fashion. With Mrs. Walker Haynes
and several millions behind her, progress was easy for
Mrs. Hallam, and within a year she was “quite in the
swim,” she said to her husband, who laughed at her
as he had done in Worcester, and called Mrs. Haynes a
fraud who knew what she was about. But he gave her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>all the money she wanted, and rather enjoyed seeing
her “hob-a-nob with the big bugs,” as he expressed it.
Nothing, however, could change him, and he remained
the same unostentatious, popular man he had always
been up to the day of his death, which occurred about
three years before our story opens.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that time there was living with him his nephew,
the son of his only brother, Jack. Reginald,—or Rex
as he was familiarly called,—was a young man of
twenty-six, with exceptionally good habits, and a few
days before his uncle died he said to him:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can trust you, Rex. You have lived with me since
you were fourteen, and have never once failed me. The
Hallams are all honest people, and you are half Hallam.
I have made you independent by my will, and I want
you to stay with your aunt and look after her affairs.
She is as good a woman as ever lived, but a little off on
fashion and fol-de-rol. Keep her as level as you can.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This Rex had tried to do, rather successfully, too,
except when Mrs. Walker Haynes’s influence was in
the ascendant, when he usually succumbed to circumstances
and allowed his aunt to do as she pleased. Mrs.
Haynes, who had profited greatly in a pecuniary way
from her acquaintance with Mrs. Hallam, was now in
Europe, and had written her friend to join her at Aix-les-Bains,
which she said was a charming place, full of
titled people both English and French, and she had the
<i><span lang="fr">entrée</span></i> to the very best circles. She further added that
it was desirable for a lady traveling without a male
escort to have a companion besides a maid and courier.
The companion was to be found in America, the courier
in London, and the maid in Paris; “after which,” she
wrote, “you will travel <i><span lang="fr">tout-à-fait en princesse</span></i>. The <i><span lang="fr">en
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>princesse</span></i> appealed to Mrs. Hallam at once as something
altogether applicable to Mrs. Carter Hallam of New
York. She was a great lady now; Sturbridge and the
old yellow house and the berries and the shoe-shop
were more than thirty years in the past, and so covered
over with gold that it seemed impossible to uncover
them; nor had any one tried, so far as she knew. The
Hallams as a family had been highly respected both in
Worcester and in Leicester, and she often spoke of
them, but never of the Browns, or of the old grandmother,
and she was glad she had no near relatives to intrude
themselves upon her and make her ashamed. She
was very fond and very proud of Reginald, who was to
her like a son, and who with the integrity and common
sense of the Hallams had also inherited the innate refinement
and kindly courtesy of his mother, a Bostonian
and the daughter of a clergyman. As a rule she consulted
him about everything, and after she received
Mrs. Haynes’s letter she showed it to him and asked his
advice in the matter of a companion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think she would be a nuisance and frightfully in
your way at times, but if Mrs. Haynes says you must
have one, it’s all right, so go ahead,” Rex replied, and
his aunt continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how am I to find what I want? I am so easily
imposed upon, and I will not have one from the city.
She would expect too much and make herself too familiar.
I must have one from the country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Advertise, then, and they’ll come round you like
bees around honey,” Rex said, and to this suggestion his
aunt at once acceded, asking him to write the advertisement,
which she dictated, with so many conditions and
requirements that Rex exclaimed, “Hold on there.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>You will insist next that they subscribe to the
Thirty-Nine Articles, besides believing in foreordination
and everything in the Westminster Catechism. You
are demanding impossibilities and giving too little in
return. Three hundred dollars for perfection! I should
say offer five hundred. ‘The higher-priced the better’
is Mrs. Walker Haynes’s motto, and I am sure she will
think it far more tony to have an expensive appendage
than a cheap one. The girl will earn her money, too,
or I’m mistaken; for Mrs. Haynes is sure to share her
services with you, as she does everything else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He spoke laughingly, but sarcastically, for he perfectly
understood Mrs. Walker Haynes, whom his outspoken
uncle had called “a sponge and a schemer, who
knew how to feather her nest.” Privately Rex thought
the same, but he did not often express these views to
his aunt, who at last consented to the five hundred dollars,
and Rex wrote the advertisement, which was as
follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>Wanted</span>,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“A companion for a lady who is going abroad. One
from the country, between twenty and twenty-five, preferred.
She must be a good accountant, a good reader,
and a good seamstress. She must also have a sufficient
knowledge of French to understand the language and
make herself understood. To such a young lady five
hundred dollars a year will be given, and all expenses
paid. Address,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Mrs. Carter Hallam</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“No. — Fifth Avenue, New York,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>When Rex read this to his aunt, she said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that will do; but don’t you think it just as well
to say <em>young person</em> instead of <em>young lady</em>?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“No, I don’t,” Rex answered, promptly. “You want
a lady, and not a <em>person</em>, as you understand the word,
and I wouldn’t begin by insulting her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So the “lady” was allowed to stand, and then, without
his aunt’s knowledge, Rex added:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Those applying will please send their photographs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should like to see the look of astonishment on
aunt’s face when the pictures come pouring in. There
will be scores of them, the offer is so good,” Rex
thought, as he folded the advertisement and left the
house.</p>

<p class='c012'>That night, when dinner was over, he said to his
aunt: “I have a project in mind which I wish to tell
you about.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Hallam gave a little shrug of annoyance. Her
husband had been full of projects, most of which she
had disapproved, as she probably should this of Rex,
who continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am thinking of buying a place in the country,—the
real country, I mean,—where the houses are old-fashioned
and far apart, and there are woods and ponds
and brooks and things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And pray what would you do with such a place?”
Mrs. Hallam asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex replied, “I’d make it into a fancy farm and fill it
with blooded stock, hunting-horses, and dogs. I’d keep
the old house intact so far as architecture is concerned,
and fit it up as a kind of bachelor’s hall, where I can
have a lot of fellows in the summer and fall, and hunt
and fish and have a glorious time. Ladies will not be
excluded, of course, and when you are fagged out with
Saratoga and Newport I shall invite you, and possibly
Mrs. Haynes and Grace, down to see the fox-hunts I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>mean to have, just as they do in the Genesee Valley.
Won’t it be fun?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex was eloquent on the subject of his fancy farm.
He was very fond of the country, although he really
knew but little about it, as he was born in New York,
and had lived there all his life with the exception of two
years spent at the South with his mother’s brother and
four years at Yale. His aunt, on the contrary, detested
the country, with its woods, and ponds, and brooks, and
old-fashioned houses, and she felt very little interest in
Rex’s fancy farm and fox-hunts, which she looked upon
as wholly visionary. She asked him, however, where
the farm was, and he replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see, Marks, who is in the office with me, has a
client who owns a mortgage on some old homestead
among the hills in Massachusetts. This mortgage,
which has changed hands two or three times and been
renewed once or twice, comes due in October, and
Marks says there is not much probability that the old
man,—I believe he is quite old,—can pay it, and the
place will be sold at auction. I can, of course, wait and
bid it off cheap, as farms are not in great demand in
that vicinity; but I don’t like to do that. I’d rather
buy it outright, giving the old fellow more than it is
worth rather than less. Marks says it is a rambling old
house, with three or four gables, and stands on a hillside
with a fine view of the surrounding country. The
woods are full of pleasant drives, and ponds where the
white lilies grow and where I can fish and have some
small boats.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But where is it? In what town, I mean?” Mrs.
Hallam asked, with a slight tremor in her voice, which,
however, Rex did not notice as he answered:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“I don’t remember where Marks’s client said it was,
but I have his letter. Let me see.” And, taking the
letter from his pocket, he glanced at it a moment, and
then said, “It is in Leicester, and not more than five or
six miles from the city of Worcester and Lake Quinsigamond,
where I mean to have a yacht and call it the
Lucy Hallam for you. Why, auntie, it has just occurred
to me that you once lived in Worcester, and Uncle Hallam,
too, and that he and father were born in Leicester.
Were you ever there,—at the house where father was
born, I mean? But of course you have been.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex had risen to his feet and stood leaning on the
mantel and looking at his aunt with an eager, expectant
expression on his face. She was pale to her lips as she
replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I was there just after I was married. Your
uncle drove me out one afternoon to see the place.
Strangers were living there then, for his father and
mother were dead. He was as country mad as you are,
and actually went down upon his knees before the old
well-sweep and bucket.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t blame him. I believe I’d do the same,” Rex
replied, and then went on questioning her rapidly.
“What was the house like? Had it a big chimney in
the centre?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Hallam said it had.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wide fireplaces?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rather wide,—yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Kitchen fireplace, with a crane?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know, but most likely.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Little window-panes, and deep window-seats?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Big iron door-latches instead of knobs?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Yes, and a brass knocker.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Slanting roof, or high?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was a high gabled roof,—three or four gables, and
must have been rather pretentious when it was new.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rex,”—and Mrs. Hallam’s voice trembled perceptibly,—“the
gables and the situation overlooking the
valley make me think that the place you have in view
is possibly your father’s old home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By Jove,” Rex exclaimed, “wouldn’t that be jolly!
I believe I’d give a thousand dollars extra for the sake
of having the old homestead for my own. I wonder
who the old chap is who lives there. I mean to go
down and see for myself as soon as I return from
Chicago and we get the lawsuit off our hands which is
taking all Marks’s time and mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Hallam did not say what she thought, for she
knew there was not much use in opposing Rex, but in
her heart she did not approve of bringing the long-buried
past up to the present, which was so different.
The Homestead was well enough, and Leicester was
well enough, for Hallam had been an honored name in
the neighborhood, and Rex would be honored, too, as a
scion of the family; but it was too near Worcester and
the shoe-shop and the store and the people who had
known her as a working-girl, and who would be sure to
renew the acquaintance if she were to go there. She
had no relatives to trouble her, unless it were a certain
Phineas Jones, who was so far removed that she could
scarcely call him a relative. But if he were living he
would certainly find her if she ventured near him, and
cousin her, as he used to do in Worcester, where he was
continually calling upon her after her marriage and reminding
her of spelling-schools and singing-schools and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>circuses which he said he had attended with her. How
distasteful it all was, and how she shrank from everything
pertaining to her early life, which seemed so far
away that she sometimes half persuaded herself it had
never been!</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet her talk with Rex about the old Homestead
on the hill had stirred her strangely, and that night,
long after her usual hour for retiring, she sat by her
window looking out upon the great city, whose many
lights, shining like stars through the fog and rain, she
scarcely saw at all. Her thoughts had gone back thirty
years to an October day just after her return from her
wedding trip to Niagara, when her husband had driven
her into the country to visit his old home. How happy
he had been, and how vividly she could recall the
expression on his face when he caught sight of the red
gables and the well-sweep where she told Reginald he
had gone down upon his knees. There had been a
similar expression on Rex’s face that evening when he
talked of his fancy farm, and Rex was in appearance
much like what her handsome young husband had been
that lovely autumn day, when a purple haze was resting
on the hills and the air was soft and warm as
summer. He had taken her first to the woods and
shown her where he and his brother Jack had set their
traps for the woodchucks and snared the partridges in
the fall and hunted for the trailing arbutus and the
sassafras in the spring; then to the old cider-mill at the
end of the lane, and to the hill where they had their
slide in winter, and to the barn, where they had a swing,
and to the brook in the orchard, where they had a
water-wheel; then to the well, where he drew up the
bucket, and, poising it upon the curb, stooped to drink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>from it, asking her to do the same and see if she ever
quaffed a sweeter draught; but she was afraid of
wetting her dress, and had drawn back, saying she was
not thirsty. Strangers occupied the house, but permission
was given them to go over it, and he had taken her
through all the rooms, showing her where he and Jack
and Annie were born, and where the latter had died
when a little child of eight; then to the garret, where
they used to spread the hickory-nuts and butternuts to
dry, and down to the cellar, where the apples and cider
were stored. He was like a school-boy in his eagerness
to explain everything, while she was bored to death and
heard with dismay his proposition to drive two or three
miles farther to the Greenville cemetery, where the
Hallams for many generations back had been buried.
There was a host of them, and some of the headstones
were sunken and mouldy with age and half fallen down,
while the lettering upon them was almost illegible.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder whose this is?” he said, as he went down
upon the ground to decipher the date of the oldest one.
“I can’t make it out, except that it is seventeen hundred
and something. He must have been an old
settler,” he continued, as he arose and brushed a patch
of dirt from his trousers with his silk handkerchief.
Then, glancing at her as she stood listlessly leaning
against a stone, he said, “Why, Lucy, you look tired.
Are you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, not very,” she answered, a little pettishly;
“but I don’t think it very exhilarating business for a
bride to be visiting the graves of her husband’s ancestors.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He did not hunt for any more dates after that, but,
gathering a few wild flowers growing in the tall grass,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>he laid them upon his mother’s grave and Annie’s, and,
going out to the carriage standing by the gate, drove
back to Worcester through a long stretch of woods,
where the road was lined on either side with sumachs
and berry-bushes and clumps of bitter-sweet, and there
was no sign of life except when a blackbird flew from
one tree to another, or a squirrel showed its bushy tail
upon the wall. He thought it delightful, and said that
it was the pleasantest drive in the neighborhood and
one which he had often taken with Jack when they
were boys; but she thought it horribly lonesome and
poky, and was glad when they struck the pavement of
the town.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Carter always liked the country,” she said to herself
when her reverie came to an end, and she left her seat
by the window; “and Rex is just like him, and will
buy that place if he can, and I shall have to go there as
hostess and be called upon by a lot of old women in
sun-bonnets and blanket shawls, who will call me Lucy
Ann and say, ‘You remember me, don’t you? I was
Mary Jane Smith; I worked in the shoe-shop with you
years ago.’ And Phineas Jones will turn up, with his
cousining and dreadful reminiscences. Ah me, what a
pity one could not be born without antecedents!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>THE HOMESTEAD.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It stood at the end of a grassy avenue or lane a little
distance from the electric road between Worcester and
Spencer, its outside chimneys covered with woodbine
and its sharp gables distinctly visible as the cars wound
up the steep Leicester hill. Just what its age was no
one knew exactly. Relic-hunters who revel in antiquities
put it at one hundred and fifty. But the oldest inhabitant
in the town, who was an authority for everything
ancient, said that when he was a small boy it was
comparatively new, and considered very fine on account
of its gables and brass knocker, and, as he was ninety-five
or six, the house was probably over a hundred.
It was built by a retired sea-captain from Boston, and
after his death it changed hands several times until it
was bought by the Hallams, who lived there so long
and were so highly esteemed that it came to bear their
name, and was known as the Hallam Homestead. After
the death of Carter Hallam’s father it was occupied by
different parties, and finally became the property of a
Mr. Leighton, who rather late in life had married a girl
from Georgia, where he had been for a time a teacher.
Naturally scholarly and fond of books, he would have
preferred teaching, but his young wife, accustomed
to plantation life, said she should be happier in the
country, and so he bought the Homestead and commenced
farming, with very little knowledge of what
ought to be done and very little means with which to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>do it. Under such circumstances he naturally grew
poorer every year, while his wife’s artistic tastes did not
help the matter. Remembering her father’s plantation
with its handsome grounds and gardens, she instituted
numerous changes in and about the house, which made
it more attractive, but did not add to its value. The
big chimney was taken down and others built upon
the outside, after the Southern style. A wide hall was
put through the centre where the chimney had been;
a broad double piazza was built in front, while the
ground was terraced down to the orchard below, where
a rustic bridge was thrown across the little brook where
Carter and Jack Hallam had built their water-wheel.
Other changes the ambitious little Georgian was contemplating,
when she died suddenly and was carried
back to sleep under her native pines, leaving her husband
utterly crushed at his loss, with the care of two
little girls, Dorcas and Bertha, and a mortgage of two
thousand dollars upon his farm. For some years he
scrambled on as best he could with hired help, giving
all his leisure time to educating and training his daughters,
who were as unlike each other as two sisters well
could be. Dorcas, the elder, was fair and blue-eyed,
and round and short and matter-of-fact, caring more
for the farm and the house than for books, while
Bertha was just the opposite, and, with her soft brown
hair, bright eyes, brilliant complexion, and graceful,
slender figure, was the exact counterpart of her beautiful
Southern mother when she first came to the Homestead;
but otherwise she was like her father, caring
more for books than for the details of every-day life.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorcas is to be housekeeper, and I the wage-earner,
to help pay off the mortgage which troubles father so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>much,” she said, and when she was through school she
became book-keeper for the firm of Swartz &#38; Co., of
Boston, with a salary of four hundred dollars a year.
Dorcas, who was two years older, remained at home as
housekeeper. And a very thrifty one she made, seeing
to everything and doing everything, from making butter
to making beds, for she kept no help. The money
thus saved was put carefully by towards paying the
mortgage coming due in October. By the closest economy
it had been reduced from two thousand to one
thousand, and both Dorcas and Bertha were straining
every nerve to increase the fund which was to liquidate
the debt.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not very often that Bertha indulged in the
luxury of coming home, for even that expense was
something, and every dollar helped. But on the Saturday
following the appearance of Mrs. Hallam’s
advertisement in the New York <cite>Herald</cite> she was coming
to spend Sunday for the first time in several weeks.
These visits were great events at the Homestead, and
Dorcas was up as soon as the first robin chirped in his
nest in the big apple-tree which shaded the rear of the
house and was now odorous and beautiful with its clusters
of pink-and-white blossoms. There was churning to
do that morning, and butter to get off to market, besides
the usual Saturday’s cleaning and baking, which
included all Bertha’s favorite dishes. There was
Bertha’s room to be gone over with broom and duster,
and all the vases and handleless pitchers to be filled
with daffies and tulips and great bunches of apple-blossoms
and a clump or two of the trailing arbutus
which had lingered late in the woods. But Dorcas’s
work was one of love; if she were tired she scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>thought of it at all, and kept steadily on until everything
was done. In her afternoon gown and white
apron she sat down to rest awhile on the piazza overlooking
the valley, thinking as she did so what a lovely
place it was, with its large, sunny rooms, wide hall, and
fine view, and how dreadful it would be to lose it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Five hundred dollars more we must have, and where
it is to come from I do not know. Bertha always says
something will turn up, but I am not so hopeful,” she
said, sadly. Then, glancing at the clock, she saw that
it was nearly time for the car which would bring her
sister from the Worcester station. “I’ll go out to the
cross-road and meet her,” she thought, just as she heard
the sharp clang of the bell and saw the trolley-pole as
it came up the hill. A moment more, and Bertha
alighted and came rapidly towards her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You dear old Dor, I’m so glad to see you and be
home again,” Bertha said, giving up her satchel and
umbrella and putting her arm caressingly around
Dorcas’s neck as she walked, for she was much the
taller of the two.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a lovely May afternoon, and the place was at
its best in the warm sunlight, with the fresh green
grass and the early flowers and the apple orchard full
of blossoms which filled the air with perfume.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, this is delightful, and it is so good to get away
from that close office and breathe this pure air,” Bertha
said, as she went from room to room, and then out
upon the piazza, where she stood taking in deep inhalations
and seeming to Dorcas to grow brighter and
fresher with each one. “Where is father?” she asked
at last.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here, daughter,” was answered, as Mr. Leighton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>who had been to the village, came through a rear
door.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was a tall, spare man, with snowy hair and a
stoop in his shoulders, which told of many years of
hard work. But the refinement in his manner and the
gentleness in his face were indicative of good breeding,
and a life somewhat different from that which he now
led.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha was at his side in a moment, and had him
down in a rocking-chair, and was sitting on an arm of
it, brushing the thin hair back from his forehead, while
she looked anxiously into his face, which wore a more
troubled expression than usual, although he evidently
tried to hide it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it, father? Are you very tired?” she asked,
at last, and he replied;</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, daughter, not very; and if I were the sight of
you would rest me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Catching sight of the corner of an envelope in his
vest pocket, with a woman’s quick intuition, she guessed
that it had something to do with his sadness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have a letter. Is there anything in it about
that hateful mortgage?” she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is all about the mortgage. There’s a way to get
rid of it,” he answered, while his voice trembled, and
something in his eyes, as he looked into Bertha’s, made
her shiver a little; but she kissed him lovingly, and
said very low:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, father. I know there is a way,” her lips quivering
as she said it, and a lump rising in her throat as
if she were smothering.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you read the letter?” he asked, and she answered:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Not now; let us have supper first. I am nearly
famished, and long to get at Dor’s rolls and broiled
chicken, which I smelled before I left the car at the
cross-roads.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was very gay all through the supper, although a
close observer might have seen a cloud cross her bright
face occasionally, and a look of pain and preoccupation
in her eyes; but she laughed and chatted merrily,
asking about the neighbors and the farm, and when
supper was over helped Dorcas with her dishes and the
evening work, sang snatches of the last opera, and told
her sister about the new bell skirt just coming into
fashion, and how she could cut over her old ones like
it. When everything was done she seemed to nerve
herself to some great effort, and, going to her father
said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now for the letter. From whom is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gorham, the man who holds the mortgage,” Mr.
Leighton replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh-h, Gorham!” and Bertha’s voice was full of intense
relief. “I thought perhaps it was —— but no
matter, that will come later. Let us hear what Mr.
Gorham has to say. He cannot foreclose till October,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And not then, if we do what he proposes. This is
it,” Mr. Leighton said, as he began to read the letter,
which was as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Brooklyn</span>, N. Y., May —, 18—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Leighton</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—A gentleman in New York wishes to
purchase a farm in the country, where he can spend a
part of the summer and autumn, fishing and fox-hunting
and so on. From what he has heard of your place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and the woods around it, he thinks it will suit him exactly,
and in the course of a few weeks proposes to go
out and see it. As he has ample means, he will undoubtedly
pay you a good price, cash down, and that
will relieve you of all trouble with the mortgage. I
still think I must have my money in October, as I have
promised it elsewhere.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Very truly,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>“<span class='sc'>John Gorham</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well?” Mr. Leighton said, as he finished reading the
letter, and looked inquiringly at his daughters.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha, who was very pale, was the first to speak.
“Do you want to leave the old home?” she asked, and
her father replied, in a choking voice, “No, oh, no. I
have lived here twenty-seven years, and know every
rock and tree and shrub, and love them all. I brought
your mother here a bride and a slip of a girl like you,
who are so much like her that sometimes when I see
you flitting around and hear your voice I think for a
moment she has come back to me again. You were
both born here. Your mother died here, and here I
want to die. But what is the use of prolonging the
struggle? I have raked and scraped and saved in
every possible way to pay the debt contracted so long
ago, the interest of which has eaten up all my profits,
and I have got within five hundred dollars of it, but do
not see how I can get any further. I may sell a few
apples and some hay, but I’ll never borrow another
dollar, and if this New York chap offers a good price
we’d better sell. Dorcas and I can rent a few rooms
somewhere in Boston, maybe, and we shall all be together
till I die, which, please God, will not be very
long.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>His face was white, with a tired, discouraged look
upon it pitiful to see, while Dorcas, who cried easily,
was sobbing aloud. But Bertha’s eyes were round and
bright and dry, and there was a ring in her voice as
she said, “You will <em>not</em> die, and you will not sell the
place. Horses and dogs and fox-hunts, indeed! I’d
like to see that New Yorker plunging through the
fields and farms with his horses and hounds, for that is
what fox-hunting means. He would be mobbed in no
time. Who is he, I wonder? I should like to meet
him and give him a piece of my mind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was getting excited, and her cheeks were scarlet
as she kissed her father again and said, “Write and tell
that New Yorker to stay where he is, and take his foxes
to some other farm. He cannot have ours, nor any one
else. Micawber-like, I believe something will turn up;
I am sure of it; only give me time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, rising from her chair, she went swiftly out into
the twilight, and, crossing the road, ran down the terrace
to a bit of broken wall, where she sat down and
watched the night gathering on the distant hills and
over the woods, and fought the battle which more than
one unselfish woman has fought,—a battle between inclination
and what seemed to be duty. If she chose,
she could save the farm with a word and make her
father’s last days free from care. There was a handsome
house in Boston of which she might be mistress
any day, with plenty of money at her command to do
with as she pleased. But the owner was old compared
to herself, forty at least, and growing bald; he called
her Berthy, and was not at all like the ideal she had in
her mind of the man whom she could love,—who was
really more like one who might hunt foxes and ride his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>horses through the fields, while she rode by his side,
than like the commonplace Mr. Sinclair, who had asked
her twice to be his wife. At her last refusal only a few
days ago he had said he should not give her up yet, but
should write her father for his co-operation, and it was
from him she feared the New York letter had come
when she saw it in her father’s pocket. She knew he
was honorable and upright and would be kind and generous
to her and her family, but she had dreamed of a
different love, and she could not listen to his suit unless
it were to save the old home for her father and Dorcas.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a time she sat weighing in the balance her love
for them and her love for herself, while darkness deepened
around her and the air grew heavy with the scent
of the apple-blossoms and the grove of pine-trees not
far away; yet she was no nearer a decision than when
she first sat down. It was strange that in the midst of
her intense thinking, the baying of hounds, the tramp
of horses’ feet, and the shout of many voices should
ring in her ears so distinctly that once, as some bushes
stirred near her, she turned, half expecting to see the
hunted fox fleeing for his life, and, with an impulse to
save him from his pursuers, put out both her hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is a queer sort of hallucination, and it comes
from that New York letter,” she thought, just as from
under a cloud where it had been hidden the new moon
sailed out to the right of her. Bertha was not superstitious,
but, like many others, she clung to some of the
traditions of her childhood, and the new moon seen
over the right shoulder was one of them. She always
framed a wish when she saw it, and she did so now,
involuntarily repeating the words she had so often used
when a child:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“New moon, new moon, listen to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And grant the boon I ask of thee,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>and then, almost as seriously as if it were a prayer, she
wished that something might occur to keep the home
for her father and herself from Mr. Sinclair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t believe much in the new moon, it has cheated
me so often; but I do believe in presentiments, and I
have one that something will turn up. I’ll wait awhile
and see,” she said, as the silvery crescent was lost again
under a cloud. Beginning to feel a little chilly, she
went back to the house, where she found her father
reading his evening paper.</p>

<p class='c012'>This reminded her of a New York <cite>Herald</cite> she had
bought on the car of a little newsboy, whose ragged
coat and pleasant face had decided her to refuse the
chocolates offered her by a larger boy and take the
paper instead. It was lying on the table, where she had
put it when she first came in. Taking it up, she sat down
and opened it. Glancing from page to page, she finally
reached the advertisements, and her eye fell upon that
of Mrs. Hallam.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, father, Dorcas, I told you something would turn
up, and there has! Listen!” and she read the advertisement
aloud. “The very thing I most desired has
come. I have always wanted to go to Europe, but
never thought I could, on account of the expense, and
here it is, all paid, and five hundred dollars besides.
That will save the place. I did not wish the new moon
for nothing. Something has turned up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Bertha,” said the more practical Dorcas, “what
reason have you to think you will get the situation?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>There are probably more than five hundred applicants
for it,—one for each dollar.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know I shall. I feel it as I have felt other things
which have come to me. Theosophic presentiments I
call them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorcas went on: “And if it does come, I don’t see
how it will help the mortgage due in October. You
will not get your pay in advance, and possibly not until
the end of the year.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall borrow the money and give my note,”
Bertha answered, promptly. “Anybody will trust me.
Swartz &#38; Co. will, anyway, knowing that I shall come
back and work it out if Mrs. Hallam fails me. By the
way, that is the name of the people who lived here years
ago. Perhaps Mrs. Carter belongs to the family. Do
you know where they are, father?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Leighton said he did not. He thought, however,
they were all dead, while Dorcas asked, “If you are
willing to borrow money of Swartz &#38; Co., why don’t
you try Cousin Louie, and pay her in installments?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cousin Louie!” Bertha repeated. “That would be
borrowing of her proud husband, Fred Thurston, who,
since I have been a bread-winner, never sees me in the
street if he can help it. I’d take in washing before I’d
ask a favor of him. My heart is set upon Europe, if
Mrs. Hallam will have me, and you do not oppose me
too strongly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I must oppose you,” her father said; and then
followed a long and earnest discussion between Mr.
Leighton, Dorcas, and Bertha, the result of which was
that Bertha was to wait a few days and consider the
matter before writing to Mrs. Hallam.</p>

<p class='c012'>That night, however, after her father had retired, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>dashed off a rough draught of what she meant to say
and submitted it to Dorcas for approval. It was as
follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Mrs. Hallam</span>:</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Madam</span>,—I have seen your advertisement for a companion,
and shall be glad of the situation. My name is
Bertha Leighton. I am twenty-two years old, and was
graduated at the Charlestown Seminary three years
ago. I am called a good reader, and ought to be a good
accountant, as for two years I have been book-keeper
in the firm of Swartz &#38; Co., Boston. I am not very
handy with my needle, for want of practice, but can
soon learn. While in school I took lessons in French
of a native teacher, who complimented my pronunciation
and quickness to comprehend. Consequently I
think I shall find no difficulty in understanding the
language after a little and making myself understood.
I enclose my photograph, which flatters me somewhat.
My address is</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I think it covers the whole business,” Bertha said
to Dorcas, who objected to one point. “The photograph
does not flatter you,” she said, while Bertha
insisted that it did, as it represented a much more
stylish-looking young woman than Mrs. Carter Hallam’s
companion ought to be. “I wonder what sort of
woman she is? I somehow fancy she is a snob,” she
said; “but, snob me all she pleases, she cannot keep
me from seeing Europe, and I don’t believe she will try
to cheat me out of my wages.”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. HALLAM’S APPLICANTS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Several days after Mrs. Hallam’s advertisement appeared
in the papers, Reginald, who had been away on
business, returned, and found his aunt in her room
struggling frantically with piles of letters and photographs
and with a very worried and excited look on her
face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Rex,” she cried, as he came in, “I am so glad
you have come, for I am nearly wild. Only think!
Seventy applicants, and as many photographs! What
possessed them to send their pictures?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex kept his own counsel, but gave a low whistle as
he glanced at the pile which filled the table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Got enough for an album, haven’t you? How do
they look as a whole?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know, and I don’t care. Such a time as I
have had reading their letters, and such recommendations
as most of them give of themselves, telling me
what reverses of fortune they have suffered, what
church they belong to, and how long they have taught
in Sunday-school, and all that, as if I cared. But I have
decided which to choose; her letter came this morning,
with one other,—the last of the lot, I trust. I like her
because she writes so plainly and sensibly and seems
so truthful. She says she is not a good seamstress
and that her picture flatters her, while most of the
others say their pictures are not good. Then she is so
respectful and simply addresses me as ‘Madam,’ while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>all the others <em>dear</em> me. If there is anything I like, it is
respect in a servant.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thunder, auntie! You don’t call your companion a
servant, do you?” Rex exclaimed, but his aunt only replied
by passing him Bertha’s letter. “She writes well.
How does she look?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here she is.” And his aunt gave him the photograph
of a short, sleepy-looking girl, with little or no
expression in her face or eyes, and an unmistakable
second-class air generally.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, horrors!” Rex exclaimed. “This girl never
wrote that letter. Why, she simpers and squints and is
positively ugly. There must be some mistake, and you
have mixed things dreadfully.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, I haven’t,” Mrs. Hallam persisted. “I was
very careful to keep the photographs and letters together
as they came. This is Bertha Leighton’s, sure,
and she says it flatters her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What must the original be!” Rex groaned.</p>

<p class='c012'>His aunt continued, “I’d rather she’d be plain than
good-looking. I don’t want her attracting attention
and looking in the glass half the time. Mrs. Haynes
always said, ‘Get plain girls by all means, in preference
to pretty ones with airs and hangers-on.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, if Mrs. Haynes says so,” Rex answered,
with a shrug of his shoulders, as he put down the photograph
of the girl he called Squint-Eye, and began carelessly
to look at the others.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh-h!” he said, catching up Bertha’s picture. “This
is something like it. By Jove, she’s a stunner. Why
don’t you take her? What splendid eyes she has, and
how she carries herself!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Read her letter,” his aunt said, handing him a note
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>in which, among other things, the writer, who gave her
name as Rose Arabella Jefferson, and claimed relationship
with Thomas Jefferson, Joe Jefferson and Jefferson
Davis, said she was a member in good standing of the
First Baptist Church, and spelled Baptist with two <em>b</em>’s.
There were also other mistakes in orthography, besides
some in grammar, and Rex dropped it in disgust, but
held fast to the photograph, whose piquant face, bright,
laughing eyes, and graceful poise of head and shoulders
attracted him greatly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rose Arabella Jefferson,” he began, “blood relation
of Joe Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson, and Jefferson
Davis, and member in good standing in the First Baptist
Church, spelled with a <em>b</em> in the middle, you never
wrote that letter, I know; and if you did, your blue
blood ought to atone for a few lapses in grammar and
spelling. I am sure Mrs. Walker Haynes would think
so. Take her, auntie, and run the risk. She is from
the country, where you said your companion must hail
from, while Squint-Eye is from Boston, with no ancestry,
no religion, and probably the embodiment of clubs
and societies and leagues and women’s rights and
Christian Science and the Lord knows what. Take
Rose Arabella.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Mrs. Hallam was firm. Rose Arabella was quite
too good-looking, and Boston was country compared with
New York. “Squint-Eye” was her choice, provided her
employers spoke well of her; and she asked Rex to
write to Boston and make inquiries of Swartz &#38; Co.,
concerning Miss Leighton.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not if I know myself,” Rex answered. “I will do
everything reasonable, but I draw the line on turning
detective and prying into any girl’s character.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>He was firm on this point, and Mrs. Hallam wrote
herself to Swartz &#38; Co., and then proceeded to tear up
and burn the numerous letters and photographs filling
her table. Rose Arabella Jefferson, however, was not
among them, for she, with other pretty girls, some
personal friends and some strangers, was adorning
Rex’s looking-glass, where it was greatly admired by
the housemaid as Mr. Reginald’s latest fancy.</p>

<p class='c012'>A few days later Mrs. Hallam said to Rex, “I have
heard from Swartz &#38; Co., and they speak in the highest
terms of Miss Leighton. I wish you would write
for me and tell her I have decided to take her, and that
she is to come to me on Friday, June —, as the Teutonic
sails the next morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Reginald did as he was requested, thinking the while
how much he would rather be writing to Rose Arabella,
<em>Babtist</em> and all, than to Bertha Leighton. But
there was no help for it; Bertha was his aunt’s choice,
and was to be her companion instead of his, he reflected,
as he directed the letter, which he posted on his way
down town. The next day he started for the West on
business for the law firm, promising his aunt that if
possible he would return in time to see her off; “and
then,” he added, “I am going to Leicester to look after
my fancy farm.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. FRED THURSTON.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bertha waited anxiously for an answer to her letter;
when it did not come she grew very nervous and restless,
and began to lose faith in the new moon and her
theosophical presentiments, as she called her convictions
of what was coming to pass. A feeling of dread
began also to haunt her lest, after all, the man with the
bald head, who called her Berthy, might be the only
alternative to save the homestead from the auctioneer’s
hammer. But the letter came at last and changed her
whole future. There was an interview with her employers,
who, having received Mrs. Hallam’s letter of
inquiry, were not surprised. Although sorry to part
with her, they readily agreed to advance whatever
money should be needed in October, without other
security than her note, which she was to leave with her
father.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was another interview with Mr. Sinclair, who
at its close had a very sorry look on his face and a suspicion
of suppressed tears in his voice as he said, “It is
hard to give you up, and I could have made you so
happy, and your father, too. Good-bye, and God bless
you. Mrs. Thurston will be disappointed. Her heart
was quite set upon having you for a neighbor, as you
would be if you were my wife. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Mrs. Thurston alluded to was Bertha’s cousin
Louie, from the South, who, four years before had spent
part of a summer at the Homestead. She had then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>gone to Newport, where she captured Fred Thurston, a
Boston millionaire, who made love to her hotly for one
month, married her the next, swore at her the next, and
in a quiet but decided manner had tyrannized over and
bullied her ever since. But he gave her all the money
she wanted, and, as that was the principal thing for
which she married him, she bore her lot bravely, became
in time a butterfly of fashion, and laughed and
danced and dressed, and went to lunches and teas and receptions
and dinners and balls, taking stimulants to keep
her up before she went, and bromide, or chloral, or sulfonal,
to make her sleep when she came home. But all
this told upon her at last, and after four years of it she
began to droop, with a consciousness that something
was sapping her strength and stealing all her vitality.
“Nervous prostration,” the physician called it, recommending
a change of air and scene, and, as a trip to
Europe had long been contemplated by Mr. Thurston,
he had finally decided upon a summer in Switzerland,
and was to sail some time in July. Mrs. Thurston was
very fond of her relatives at the Homestead, and especially
of Bertha, who when she was first married was a
pupil in Charlestown Seminary and spent nearly every
Sunday with her. After a while, however, and for no
reason whatever except that on one or two occasions he
had shown his frightful temper before her, Mr. Thurston
conceived a dislike for Bertha and forbade Louie’s
inviting her so often to his house, saying he did not
marry her poor relations. This put an end to any close
intimacy between the cousins, and although Bertha
called occasionally she seldom met Louie’s husband, who,
after she entered the employment of Swartz &#38; Co., rarely
recognized her in the street. Bread-winners were far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>beneath his notice, and Bertha was a sore point between
him and his wife, who loved her cousin with the devotion
of a sister and often wrote, begging her to come, if only
for an hour.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Bertha was too proud to trespass where the master
did not want her, and it was many weeks since they
had met. She must go now and say good-bye. And
after Mr. Sinclair left her she walked along Commonwealth
Avenue to her cousin’s elegant house, which
stood side by side with one equally handsome, of which
she had just refused to be mistress. But she scarcely
glanced at it, or, if she did, it was with no feeling of regret
as she ran up the steps and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Thurston was at home and alone, the servant
said, and Bertha, who went up unannounced, found her
in her pleasant morning room, lying on a couch in the
midst of a pile of cushions, with a very tired look upon
her lovely face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Bertha,” she exclaimed, springing up with outstretched
hands, as her cousin came in, “I am so glad
to see you! Where have you kept yourself so long?
And when are you coming to be my neighbor? I saw
Mr. Sinclair last week, and he still had hopes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha replied by telling what the reader already,
knows, and adding that she had come to say good-bye,
as she was to sail in two weeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, how could you refuse him, and he so kind and
good, and so fond of you?” Louie said.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha, between whom and her cousin there were no
domestic secrets, replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because I do not love him, and never can, good and
kind as I know him to be. With your experience,
would you advise me to marry for money?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Instantly a shadow came over Louie’s face, and she
hesitated a little before she answered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and no; all depends upon the man, and
whether you loved some one else. If you knew he
would swear at you, and call you names, and storm before
the servants, and throw things,—not at you, perhaps,
but at the side of the house,—I should say no,
decidedly; but if he were kind, and good, and generous,
like Charlie Sinclair, I should say yes. I did so want
you for my neighbor. Can’t you reconsider? Who is
Mrs. Hallam, I wonder? I know some Hallams, or a
Hallam,—Reginald. He lives in New York, and it
seems to me his aunt’s name is Mrs. Carter Hallam.
Let me tell you about him. I feel like talking of the
old life in Florida, which seems so long ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was reclining again among the cushions, with one
arm under her head, a far-away look in her eyes, and a
tone in her voice as if she were talking to herself rather
than to Bertha.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know my father lived in Florida,” she began,
“not far from Tallahassee, and your mother lived over
the line in Georgia. Our place was called Magnolia
Grove, and there were oleanders and yellow jasmine
and Cherokee roses everywhere. This morning when I
was so tired and felt that life was not worth the living, I
fancied I was in my old home again, and I smelled the
orange blossoms and saw the magnolias which bordered
the avenue to our house, fifty or more, in full bloom,
and Rex and I were playing under them. His uncle’s
plantation joined ours, and when his mother died in
Boston he came to live with her brother at Grassy
Spring. He was twelve and I was nine, and I had never
played with any boy before except the negroes, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>were so fond of each other. He called me his little
sweetheart, and said he was going to marry me when
he was older. When he was fourteen, his uncle on his
father’s side, a Mr. Hallam, from New York, sent for
him, and he went away, promising to come back again
when he was a man. We wrote to each other a few
times, just boy and girl letters, you know. He called
me Dear Louie and I called him Dear Rex, and then, I
hardly know why, that chapter of my life closed, never
to be reopened. Grandfather, who owned Magnolia
Grove, lost nearly everything during the war, so that
father, who took the place after him, was comparatively
poor, and when he died we were poorer still, mother
and I, and had to sell the plantation and move to Tallahassee,
where we kept boarders,—people from the
North, mostly, who came there for the winter. I was
sixteen then, and I tried to help mother all I could. I
dusted the rooms, and washed the glass and china, and
did a lot of things I never thought I’d have to do.
When I was eighteen Rex Hallam came to Jacksonville
and ran over to see us. If he had been handsome as a
boy of fourteen, he was still handsomer as a man of
twenty-one, with what in a woman would be called a
sweet graciousness of manner which won all hearts to
him; but as he is a man I will drop the sweet and say
that he was kind alike to everybody, old and young,
rich and poor, and had the peculiar gift of making
every woman think she was especially pleasing to him,
whether she were married or single, pretty or otherwise.
He stopped with us a week, and because I was
so proud and rebellious against our changed circumstances,
and so ashamed to have him find me dusting
and washing dishes, I was cold and stiff towards him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and our old relations were not altogether resumed,
although he was very kind. Sometimes for fun he
helped me dust, and once he wiped the dishes for me
and broke a china teapot, and then he went away and I
never saw him again till last summer, when I met him
at Saratoga. Fred, who was with him in college, introduced
us to each other, supposing we were strangers.
You ought to have seen the look of surprise on Rex’s
face when Fred said, ‘This is my wife.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, Louie,” he exclaimed, “I don’t need an introduction
to you,” then to my husband, “We are old
friends, Louie and I;” and we told him of our early
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For a wonder, Fred did not seem a bit jealous of
him, although savage if another man looked at me.
Nor had he any cause, for Rex’s manner was just like a
brother’s, but oh, such a brother! And I was so happy
the two weeks he was there. We drove and rode and
danced and talked together, and never but once did he
refer to the past. Then, in his deep, musical voice, the
most musical I ever heard in a man, he said, ‘I thought
you were going to wait for me,’ and I answered, ‘I did
wait, and you never came.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was all; but the night before he went away
he was in our room and asked for my photograph,
which was lying upon the table. He had quite a collection,
he said, and would like to add mine to it, and I
gave it to him. Fred knew it and was willing, but since
then, when he is in one of his moods, he taunts me
with it, and says he knew I was in love with Rex all the
time,—that he saw it in my face, and that Rex saw it,
too, and despised me for it while pretending to admire
me, and because he knew Rex despised me and he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>trust him, he allowed me full liberty just to see how
far I would go and not compromise myself. I do not
believe it of Rex: he never despised any woman; but
it is hard to hear such things, and sometimes when Fred
is worse than usual and I have borne all I can bear, I
go away and cry, with an intense longing for something
different, which might perhaps have come to me
if I had waited, and I hear Rex’s boyish voice just as it
sounded under the magnolias in Florida, where we
played together and pelted each other with the white
petals strewing the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am not false to Fred in telling this to you, who
know about my domestic life, which, after all, has
some sunshine in it. Fred is not always cross. Every
one has a good and a bad side, a Jekyll and Hyde, you
know, and if Fred has more Hyde than Jekyll, it is not
his fault, perhaps. I try him in many ways. He says
I am a fool, and that I only care for his money, and if
he gives me all I want I ought to be satisfied. Just now
he is very good,—so good, in fact, that I wonder if he
isn’t going to die. I believe he thinks I am, I am so
weak and tired. I have not told you, have I, that we, too,
are going to Europe before long? Switzerland is our
objective point, but if I can I will persuade Fred to go
to Aix, where you will be. That will be jolly. I wonder
if your Mrs. Hallam can be Rex’s aunt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you ever see her?” Bertha asked, and Louie replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only in the distance. She was in Saratoga with
him, but at another hotel. I heard she was a very swell
woman with piles of money, and that when young she
had made shoes and worked in a factory, or something.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“How shocking!” Bertha said, laughingly, and Louie
rejoined:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be sarcastic. You know I don’t care what
she used to do. Why should I, when I have dusted and
washed dishes myself, and waited on a lot of Northern
boarders, with my proud Southern blood in hot rebellion
against it? If Mrs. Hallam made shoes or cloth,
what does it matter, so long as she is rich now and in
the best society? She is no blood relation to Rex, who
is a gentleman by birth and nature both. I hope Mrs.
Carter is his aunt, for then you will see him; and if
you do, tell him I am your cousin, but not how wretched
I am. He saw a little in Saratoga, but not much, for
Fred was very guarded. Hark! I believe I hear him
coming.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a bright flush on her cheeks as she started
up and began to smooth the folds of her dress and to
arrange her hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fred does not like to see me tumbled,” she said, just
as the portière was drawn aside and her husband entered
the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was a tall and rather fine-looking man of thirty,
with large, fierce black eyes and an expression on his
face and about his mouth indicative of an indomitable
will and a temper hard to meet. He had come in, he
said, to take Louie for a drive, as the day was fine and
the air would do her good; and he was so gracious to
Bertha that she felt sure the Jekyll mood was in the
ascendant. He asked her if she was still with Swartz
&#38; Co., and listened with some interest while Louie told
him of her engagement with Mrs. Carter Hallam, and
when she asked if that lady was Rex’s aunt, he replied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>that she was, adding that Rex’s uncle had adopted him
as a son and had left a large fortune.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, turning to Bertha, he said, “I congratulate you
on your prospective acquaintance with Rex Hallam.
He is very susceptible to female charms, and quite
indiscriminate in his attentions. Every woman, old or
young, is apt to think he is in love with her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He spoke sarcastically, with a meaning look at his
wife, whose face was scarlet. Bertha was angry, and,
with a proud inclination of her head, said to him:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not likely that I shall see much of Mr. Reginald
Hallam. Why should I, when I am only his
aunt’s hired companion, and have few charms to attract
him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am not so sure of that,” Fred said, struck as he had
never been before with Bertha’s beauty, as she stood
confronting him.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was a magnificent-looking girl, who, given a
chance, would throw Louie quite in the shade, he
thought, and under the fascination of her beauty he
became more gracious than ever, and asked her to drive
with them and return to lunch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, do,” Louie said. “It is ages since you were
here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Bertha declined, as she had shopping to do, and
in the afternoon was going home to stay until it was
time to report herself to Mrs. Hallam. Then, bidding
them good-bye, she left the house and went rapidly
down the avenue.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Bertha kept up very bravely when she said good-bye
to her father and Dorcas and started alone for New
York; but there was a horrid sense of loneliness and
homesickness in her heart when at about six in the
afternoon she rang the bell of No. — Fifth Avenue,
looking in her sailor hat and tailor-made gown and
Eton jacket of dark blue serge more like the daughter
of the house than like a hired companion. Peters, the
colored man who opened the door, mistook her for an
acquaintance, and was very deferential in his manner,
while he waited for her card. By mistake her cards
were in her trunk, and she said to him, “Tell Mrs.
Hallam that Miss Leighton is here. She is expecting
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Hallam’s servants usually managed to know the
most of their mistress’s business, for, although she professed
to keep them at a distance, she was at times
quite confidential, and they all knew that a Miss Leighton
was to accompany her abroad as a companion. So
when Peters heard the name he changed his intention
to usher her into the reception-room, and, seating her
in the hall, went for a maid, who took her to a room on
the fourth floor back and told her that Mrs. Hallam had
just gone in to dinner with some friends and would not
be at liberty to see her for two or three hours.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But she is expecting you,” she said, “and has given
orders that you can have your dinner served here, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>if you choose, you can dine with Mrs. Flagg, the housekeeper,
in her room in the front basement. I should go
there, if I were you. You’ll find it pleasanter and
cooler than up here under the roof.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha preferred the housekeeper’s room, to which
she was taken by the maid. Mrs. Flagg was a kind-hearted,
friendly woman, who, with the quick instincts
of her class, recognized Bertha as a lady and treated
her accordingly. She had lived with the Hallams
many years, and, with a natural pride in the family,
talked a good deal of her mistress’s wealth and position,
but more of Mr. Reginald, who had a pleasant word for
everybody, high or low, rich or poor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Hallam is not exactly that way,” she said, “and
sometimes snubs folks beneath her; but I’ve heard Mr.
Reginald tell her that civil words don’t cost anything,
and the higher up you are and the surer of yourself the
better you can afford to be polite to every one; that a
gold piece is none the less gold because there is a lot of
copper pennies in the purse with it, nor a real lady any
the less a lady because she is kind of chummy with her
inferiors. He’s great on comparisons.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As Bertha made no comment, she continued, “He’s
Mrs. Hallam’s nephew, or rather her husband’s, but
the same as her son;” adding that she was sorry he was
not at home, as she’d like Miss Leighton to see him.</p>

<p class='c012'>When dinner was over she offered to take Bertha
back to her room, and as they passed an open door on
the third floor she stopped a moment and said, “This is
Mr. Reginald’s room. Would you like to go in?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha did not care particularly about it, but as Mrs.
Flagg stepped inside, she followed her. Just then some
one from the hall called to Mrs. Flagg, and, excusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>herself for a moment, she went out, leaving Bertha
alone. It was a luxuriously furnished apartment, with
signs of masculine ownership everywhere, but what
attracted Bertha most was a large mirror which, in a
Florentine frame, covered the entire chimney above the
mantel and was ornamented with photographs on all its
four sides. There were photographs of personal friends
and prominent artists, authors, actors, opera-singers,
and ballet-dancers, with a few of horses and dogs,
divided into groups, with a blank space between.
Bertha had no difficulty in deciding which were his
friends, for there confronting her, with her sunny smile
and laughing blue eyes, was Louie’s picture given to
him at Saratoga, and placed by the side of a sweet-faced,
refined-looking woman wearing a rather old-style
dress, who, Bertha fancied, might be his mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How lovely Louie is,” she thought, “and what a
different life hers would have been had her friendship
for Reginald Hallam ripened into love, as it ought to
have done!” Then, casting her eyes upon another
group, she started violently as she saw herself tucked in
between a rope-walker and a ballet-dancer. “What
does it mean? and how did my picture get here?” she
exclaimed, taking it from the frame and wondering still
more when she read upon it, “Rose Arabella Jefferson,
Scotsburg.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rose Arabella Jefferson!” she repeated. “Who is
she? and how came her name on my picture? and how
came my picture in Rex Hallam’s possession?” Then,
remembering that she had sent it by request to Mrs.
Hallam, she guessed how Rex came by it, and felt a
little thrill of pride that he had liked it well enough to
give it a place in his collection, even if it were in company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>with ballet-girls. “But it shall not stay there,”
she thought. “I’ll put it next to Louie’s, and let him
wonder who changed it, if he ever notices the change.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Flagg was coming, and, hastily putting the
photograph between Louie’s and that of a woman who
she afterwards found was Mrs. Carter Hallam, she went
out to meet the housekeeper, whom she followed to her
room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will not be afraid, as the servants all sleep up
here. We have six besides the coachman,” Mrs. Flagg
said as she bade her good-night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Six servants besides the coachman and housekeeper!
I make the ninth, for I dare say I am little more than
that in my lady’s estimation,” Bertha thought, as she
sat alone, watching the minute-hand of the clock creeping
slowly round, and wondering when the grand dinner
would be over and Mrs. Hallam ready to receive
her. Then, lest the lump in her throat should get the
mastery, she began to walk up and down her rather
small quarters, to look out of the window upon the
roofs of the houses, and to count the chimneys and
spires in the distance.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was very different from the lookout at home, with
its long stretch of wooded hills, its green fields and
meadows and grassy lane. Once her tears were threatening
every moment to start, when a maid appeared
and said her mistress was at liberty to see her. With a
beating heart and heightened color, Bertha followed
her to the boudoir, where, in amber satin and diamonds
Mrs. Hallam was waiting, herself somewhat flurried
and nervous and doubtful how to conduct herself during
the interview. She was always a little uncertain
how to maintain a dignity worthy of Mrs. Carter Hallam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>under all circumstances, for, although she had been in
society so long and had seen herself quoted and her
dinners and receptions described so often, she was not
yet quite sure of herself, nor had she learned the truth
of Rex’s theory that gold was not the less gold because
in the same purse with pennies. She had never forgotten
the shoe-shop and the barefoot girl picking
berries, with all the other humble surroundings of her
childhood, and because she had not she felt it incumbent
upon her to try to prove that she was and always had
been what she seemed to be, a leader of fashion, with
millions at her command. To compass this she assumed
an air of haughty superiority towards those whom
she thought her inferiors. She had never hired a companion,
and in the absence of her mentor, Mrs. Walker
Haynes, she did not know exactly how to treat one.
Had she asked Rex, he would have said, “Treat her
as you would any other young lady.” But Rex
held some very ultra views, and was not to be trusted
implicitly. Fortunately, however, a guest at dinner
had helped her greatly by recounting her own experience
with a companion who was always getting out of
her place, and who finally ran off with a French count at
Trouville, where they were spending the summer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I began wrong,” the lady said. “I was too familiar
at first, and made too much of her because she was educated
and superior to her class.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Acting upon this intimation, Mrs. Hallam decided to
commence right. Remembering the picture which Rex
called Squint-Eye, she had no fear that the original
would ever run off with a French count, but she might
have to be put down, and she would begin by sitting
down to receive her. “Standing will make her too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>much my equal,” she thought, and, adjusting the folds
of her satin gown and assuming an expression which
she meant to be very cold and distant, she glanced up
carelessly, but still a little nervously, as she heard the
sound of footsteps and knew there was some one at the
door. She was expecting a very ordinary-looking person,
with wide mouth, half-closed eyes, and light hair,
and when she saw a tall, graceful girl, with dark hair
and eyes, brilliant color, and an air decidedly patrician,
as Mrs. Walker Haynes would say, she was startled out
of her dignity, and involuntarily rose to her feet and
half extended her hand. Then, remembering herself,
she dropped it, and said, stammeringly, “Oh, are you
Miss Leighton?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, madam. You were expecting me, were you
not?” Bertha answered, her voice clear and steady,
with no sound of timidity or awe in it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, yes; that is—sit down, please. There is
some mistake,” Mrs. Hallam faltered. “You are not
like your photograph, or the one I took for you. They
must have gotten mixed, as Rex said they did. He insisted
that your letter did not belong to what I said was
your photograph and which he called Squint-Eye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here it occurred to Mrs. Hallam that she was not
commencing right at all,—that she was quite too communicative
to a girl who looked fully equal to running
off with a duke, if she chose, and who must be kept
down. But she explained about the letters and the
photographs until Bertha had a tolerably correct idea
of the mistake and laughed heartily over it. It was a
very merry, musical laugh, in which Mrs. Hallam joined
for a moment. Then, resuming her haughty manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>she plied Bertha with questions, saying to her first,
“Your home is in Boston, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” Bertha replied. “My home is in Leicester,
where I was born.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In Leicester!” Mrs. Hallam replied, her voice indicative
of surprise and disapprobation. “You wrote
me from Boston. Why did you do that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha explained why, and Mrs. Hallam asked next
if she lived in the village or the country.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the country, on a farm,” Bertha answered, wondering
at Mrs. Hallam’s evident annoyance at finding
that she came from Leicester instead of Boston.</p>

<p class='c012'>It had not before occurred to her to connect the
Homestead with Mrs. Carter Hallam, but it came to her
now, and at a venture she said, “Our place is called
the Hallam Homestead, named for a family who lived
there many years ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was looking curiously at Mrs. Hallam, whose face
was crimson at first and then grew pale, but who for a
moment made no reply. Here was a complication,—Leicester,
and perhaps the old life, brought home to her
by the original of the picture so much admired by Rex,
who had it in mind to buy the old Homestead, and was
sure to admire the girl when he saw her, as he would,
for he was coming to Aix-les-Bains some time during
the summer. If Mrs. Hallam could have found an excuse
for it, she would have dismissed Bertha at once.
But there was none. She was there, and she must keep
her, and perhaps it might be well to be frank with her
to a certain extent. So she said at last, “My husband’s
family once lived in Leicester,—presumably on your
father’s farm. That was years ago, before I was married.
My nephew, Mr. Reginald” (she laid much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>stress on the <em>Mr.</em>, as if to impress Bertha with the distance
there was between them), “has, I believe, some
quixotic notion about buying the old place. Is it for
sale?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The fire which flashed into Bertha’s eyes and the hot
color which stained her cheeks startled Mrs. Hallam,
who was not prepared for Bertha’s excitement as she
replied, “For sale! Never! There is a mortgage of
long standing on it, but it will be paid in the fall. I
am going with you to earn the money to pay it. Nothing
else would take me from father and Dorcas so long.
We heard there was a New York man wishing to buy
it, but he may as well think of buying the Coliseum as
our home. Tell him so, please, for me. Hallam Homestead
is <em>not</em> for sale.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As she talked, Bertha grew each moment more earnest
and excited and beautiful, with the tears shining in
her eyes and the bright color on her cheeks. Mrs. Hallam
was not a hard woman, nor a bad woman; she was
simply calloused over with false ideas of caste and position,
which prompted her to restrain her real nature
whenever it asserted itself, as it was doing now. Something
about Bertha fascinated and interested her, bringing
back the long ago, with the odor of the pines, the
perfume of the pond-lilies, and the early days of her
married life. But this feeling soon passed. Habit is
everything, and she had been the fashionable Mrs.
Carter Hallam so long that it would take more than a
memory of the past to change her. She must maintain
her dignity, and not give way to sentiment, and she was
soon herself, cold and distant, with her chin in the air,
where she usually carried it when talking to those
whom she wished to impress with her superiority.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>For some time longer she talked to Bertha, and
learned as much of her history as Bertha chose to tell.
Her mother was born in Georgia, she said; her father
in Boston. He was a Yale graduate, and fonder of
books than of farming. They were poor, keeping no servants;
Dorcas, her only sister, kept the house, while she
did what she could to help pay expenses and lessen the
mortgage on the farm. All this Bertha told readily
enough, with no thought of shame for her poverty.
She saw that Mrs. Hallam was impressed with the
Southern mother and scholarly father, and once she
thought to speak of her cousin, Mrs. Louie, but did not,
and here she possibly made a mistake, for Mrs. Hallam
had a great respect for family connections, as that was
what she lacked. She had heard of Mrs. Fred Thurston,
as had every frequenter of Saratoga and Newport,
and once at the former place she had seen her driving
in her husband’s stylish turnout with Reginald at her
side. He was very attentive to the beauty whom he
had known at the South, and Mrs. Hallam had once or
twice intimated to him that she, too, would like to meet
her, but he had not acted upon the hint, and she had
left Saratoga without accomplishing her object. Had
Bertha told of the relationship between herself and
Louie, it might have made some difference in her relations
with her employer. But she did not, and after a
little further catechising Mrs. Hallam dismissed her,
saying, “As the ship sails at nine, it will be necessary
to rise very early; so I will bid you good-night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The next morning Bertha breakfasted with Mrs.
Flagg, who told her that, as a friend was to accompany
Mrs. Hallam in her coupé to the ship, she was to go in
a street-car, with a maid to show her the way.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Evidently I am a hired servant and nothing more,”
Bertha thought; “but I can endure even that for the
sake of Europe and five hundred dollars.” And, bidding
good-bye to Mrs. Flagg, she was soon on her way
to the Teutonic.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>ON THE TEUTONIC.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Bertha found Mrs. Hallam in her state-room, which
was one of the largest and most expensive on the ship.
With her were three or four ladies who were there to
say good-bye, all talking together and offering advice
in case of sickness, while Mrs. Hallam fanned herself
vigorously, as the morning was very hot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you not taking a maid?” one of the ladies
asked, and Mrs. Hallam replied that Mrs. Haynes advised
her to get one in Paris, adding, “I have a young
girl as companion, and I’m sure I don’t know where
she is. She ought to be here by this time. I dare say
she will be more trouble than good. She seems quite
the fine lady. I hardly know what I am to do with
her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Keep her in her place,” was the prompt advice of a
little, common-looking woman, who was once a nursery
governess, but was now a millionaire, and perfectly
competent to advise as to the proper treatment of a
companion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then Bertha appeared, and was stared at by the
ladies, who took no further notice of her.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“I am glad you’ve got here at last. What kept you
so long?” Mrs. Hallam asked, a little petulantly, while
Bertha replied that she had been detained by a block in
the street cars, and asked if there was anything she
could do.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mrs. Hallam answered. “I wish you would
open my sea trunk and satchel, and get out my wrapper,
and shawl, and cushion, and toilet articles, and
salts, and camphor. I am sure to be sick the minute we
get out to sea.” And handing her keys to Bertha, she
went with her friends outside, where the crowd was
increasing every moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>The passenger-list was full, and every passenger had
at least half a dozen acquaintances to see him off, so
that by the time Bertha had arranged Mrs. Hallam’s
belongings, and gone out on deck, there was hardly
standing room. Finding a seat near the purser’s office,
she sat down and watched the surging mass of human
beings, jostling, pushing, crowding each other, the confusion
reaching its climax when the order came for the
ship to be cleared of all visitors. Then for a time they
stood so thickly around her that she could see nothing
and hear nothing but a confused babel of voices, until
suddenly there was a break in the ranks, and a tall
young man, who had been fighting his way to the plank,
pitched headlong against her with such force that she
fell from the seat, losing her hat in the fall, and striking
her forehead on a sharp point near her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I beg your pardon; are you much hurt? I am so
sorry, but I could not help it, they pushed me so in this
infernal crowd. Let me help you up,” a pleasant, manly
voice, full of concern, said to her, while two strong
hands lifted her to her feet, and on to the seat where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>she had been sitting. “You are safe here, unless some
other blunderhead knocks you down again,” the young
man continued, as he managed to pick up her hat.
“Some wretch has stepped on it, but I think I can
doctor it into shape,” he said, giving it a twist or two,
and then putting it very carefully on Bertha’s head
hind side before. “There! It is all right, I think,
though, upon my soul, it does seem a little askew,” he
added, looking for the first time fully at Bertha, who
was holding her hand to her forehead, where a big
bump was beginning to show.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her hand hid a portion of her face, but she smiled
brightly and gratefully upon the stranger, whose manner
was so friendly and whose brown eyes seen through
his glasses looked so kindly at her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By Jove, you are hurt,” he continued, “and I did it.
I can’t help you, as I’ve got to go, but my aunt is on
board,—Mrs. Carter Hallam; find her, and tell her that
her awkward nephew came near knocking your brains
out. She has every kind of drug and lotion imaginable,
from morphine to Pond’s extract, and is sure to find
something for that bump. And now I must go or be
carried off.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He gave another twist to her hat and offered her his
hand, and then ran down the plank to the wharf, where,
with hundreds of others, he stood, waving his hat and
cane to his friends on the ship, which began to move
slowly from the dock. He was so tall that Bertha
could see him distinctly, and she stood watching him
and him alone, until he was a speck in the distance.
Then, with a feeling of loneliness, she started for her
state-room, where Mrs. Hallam, who had preceded her,
was looking rather cross and doing her best to be sick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>although as yet there was scarcely any motion to the
vessel.</p>

<p class='c012'>Reginald, whose train was late, had hurried at once
to the ship, which he reached in time to see his aunt
for a few moments only. Her last friend had said good-bye,
and she was feeling very forlorn, and wondering
where Bertha could be, when he came rushing up,
bringing so much life and sunshine and magnetism
with him that Mrs. Hallam began to feel doubly forlorn
as she wondered what she should do without
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Rex,” she said, laying her head on his arm and
beginning to cry a little, “I am so glad you have come,
and I wish you were going with me. I fear I have
made a mistake starting off alone. I don’t know at all
how to take care of myself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex smoothed her hair, patted her hand, soothed her
as well as he could, and told her he was sure she would
get on well enough and that he would certainly join her
in August.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Miss Leighton? Hasn’t she put in an
appearance?” he asked, and his aunt replied, with a little
asperity of manner:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes; she came last night, and she seems a high and
mighty sort of damsel. I am disappointed, and afraid I
shall have trouble with her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sit down on her if she gets too high and mighty,”
Rex said, laughingly, while his aunt was debating the
propriety of telling him of the mistake and who Bertha
was.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t believe I will. He will find it out soon
enough,” she thought, just as the last warning to leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the boat was given, and with a hurried good-bye Rex
left her, saying, as he did so:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll look a bit among the crowd, and if I find your
squint-eyed damsel I’ll send her to you. I shall know
her in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here was a good chance to explain, but Mrs. Hallam
let it pass, and Rex went his way, searching here and
there for a light-haired, weak-eyed woman answering to
her photograph.</p>

<p class='c012'>But he did not find her, and ran instead against
Bertha, with no suspicion that she was the girl he had
told his aunt to sit on, and for whom that lady waited
rather impatiently after the ship was cleared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” she said, as Bertha came in. “I have been
waiting for you some time. Did you have friends to say
good-bye to? Give me my salts, please, and camphor,
and fan, and a pillow, and close that shutter. I don’t
want the herd looking in upon me; nor do I think this
room so very desirable, with all the people passing and
repassing. I told Rex so, and he said nobody wanted
to see me in my night-cap. He was here to say good-bye.
His train got in just in time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha closed the shutters and brought a pillow and
fan and the camphor and salts, and then bathed the
bruise on her forehead, which was increasing in size and
finally attracted Mrs. Hallam’s attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you hurt?” she asked, and Bertha replied, “I
was knocked down in the crowd by a young man who
told me he had an aunt, a Mrs. Hallam, on board. I
suppose he must have been your nephew.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you tell him who you were?” Mrs. Hallam
asked, with a shake of her head and disapproval in her
voice.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“No, madam,” Bertha replied. “He was trying to
apologize for what he had done, and spoke to me of you
as one to whom I could go for help if I was badly hurt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that is like Reginald,—thinking of everything,”
Mrs. Hallam said. After a moment she added, “He
has lived with me since he was a boy, and is the same
as a son. He will join me in Aix-les-Bains in August.
Miss Grace Haynes is there, and I don’t mind telling
you, as you will probably see for yourself, that I think
there is a sort of understanding between him and her.
Nothing would please me better.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There! I have headed off any idea she might possibly
have with regard to Rex, who is so democratic and
was so struck with her photograph, while she,—well,
there is something in her eyes and the lofty way she
carries her head and shoulders that I don’t like; it looks
too much like equality, and I am afraid I may have to
sit on her, as Rex bade me do,” was Mrs. Hallam’s
mental comment, as she adjusted herself upon her couch
and issued her numerous orders.</p>

<p class='c012'>For three days she stayed in her state-room, not
because she was actually sea-sick, but because she
feared she would be. To lie perfectly quiet in her berth
until she was accustomed to the motion of the vessel
was the advice given her by one of her friends, and as
far as possible she followed it, while Bertha was kept in
constant attendance, reading to her, brushing her hair,
bathing her head, opening and shutting the windows,
and taking messages to those of her acquaintances able
to be on deck. The sea was rather rough for June, but
Bertha was not at all affected by it, and the only inconvenience
she suffered was want of sufficient exercise and
fresh air. Early in the morning, while Mrs. Hallam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>slept, she was free to go on deck, and again late in the
evening, after the lady had retired for the night. These
walks, with going to her meals, were the only recreation
or change she had, and she was beginning to droop
a little, when at last Mrs. Hallam declared herself able
to go upon deck, where, by the aid of means which
seldom fail, she managed to gain possession of the sunniest
and most sheltered spot, which she held in spite of
the protestations of another party who claimed the
place on the ground of first occupancy. She was Mrs.
Carter Hallam, and she kept the field until a vacancy
occurred in the vicinity of some people whom to know,
if possible, was desirable. Then she moved, and had
her reward in being told by one of the magnates that
it was a fine day and the ship was making good time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every morning Bertha brought her rugs and wraps
and cushions and umbrella, and after seeing her comfortably
adjusted sat down at a respectful distance and
waited for orders, which were far more frequent than
was necessary. No one spoke to her, although many
curious and admiring glances were cast at the bright,
handsome girl who seemed quite as much a lady as her
mistress, but who was performing the duties of a maid
and was put down upon the passenger-list as Mrs. Hallam’s
companion. As it chanced, there was a royal
personage on board, and one day when standing near,
Bertha, who was watching a steamer just appearing
upon the horizon, he addressed some remark to her, and
then, attracted by something in her face, or manner, or
both, continued to talk with her, until Mrs. Hallam’s
peremptory voice called out:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bertha, I want you, Don’t you see my rug is falling
off?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>There was a questioning glance at the girl thus bidden
and at the woman who bade her, and then, lifting
his hat politely to the former, the stranger walked away,
while Bertha went to Mrs. Hallam, who said to her
sharply:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder at your presumption; but possibly you did
not know to whom you were talking?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes, I did,” Bertha replied. “It was the prince.
He speaks English fluently, and I found him very agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was apparently as unconcerned as if it had been
the habit of her life to consort with royalty, and Mrs.
Hallam looked at her wonderingly, conscious in her
narrow soul of an increased feeling of respect for the
girl whom a prince had honored with his notice and
who took it so coolly and naturally. But she did not
abate her requirements or exactions in the least. On
the contrary, it seemed as if she increased them. But
Bertha bore it all patiently, performing every task
imposed upon her as if it were a pleasure, and
never giving any sign of fatigue, although in reality
she was never so tired in her life as when at last they
sailed up the Mersey and into the docks at Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c012'>At Queenstown she sent off a letter to Dorcas, in
which, after speaking of her arrival in New York and
the voyage in general, she wrote, “I hardly know what
to say of Mrs. Hallam until I have seen more of her.
She is a great lady, and great ladies need a great deal
of waiting upon, and the greater they are the greater
their need. There must be something Shylocky in her
nature, and, as she gives me a big salary, she means to
have her pound of flesh. I am down on the passenger-list as her companion, but it should be maid, as I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>really that. But when we reach Paris there will be a
change, as she is to have a French maid there. It will
surprise you, as it did me, to know that she belongs to
the Hallams for whom the Homestead was named and
who father thought were all dead. Her husband was
born there. Where she came from I do not know.
She is very reticent on that point. I shouldn’t be surprised
if she once worked in a factory, she is so particular
to have her position recognized. Such a scramble
as she had to get to the captain’s table; though what
good that does I cannot guess, inasmuch as he is seldom
there himself. I am at <em>Nobody’s</em> table, and like it, because
I am a nobody.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you remember the letter father had, saying that
some New Yorker wanted to buy our farm and was
coming to look at it? That New Yorker is cousin
Louie’s Reginald Hallam, of whom I told you, and Mrs.
Carter’s nephew; not in the least like her, I fancy,
although I have only had the pleasure of being knocked
down by him on the ship. But he was not to blame.
The crowd pushed him against me with such force that
I fell off the seat and nearly broke my head. My hat
was crushed out of all shape, and he made it worse trying
to twist it back. He was kindness itself, and his brown
eyes full of concern as they looked at me through the
clearest pair of rimless glasses I ever saw. He did not
know who I was, of course, but I am sure he would
have been just as kind if he had. I can understand
Louie’s infatuation for him, and why his aunt adores
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what nonsense to be writing with Queenstown
in sight, and this letter must be finished to send off. I
am half ashamed of what I have said of Mrs. Hallam,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>who when she forgets what a grand lady she is, can be
very nice, and I really think she likes me a little.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now I must close, with more love for you and
father than can be carried in a hundred letters. Will
write again from Paris. Good-bye, good-bye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“P. S. I told you that if a New Yorker came to buy
the farm you were to shut the door in his face. But
you may as well let him in.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='large'>REGINALD AND PHINEAS JONES.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>After bidding his aunt good-bye, Reginald went
home for a few moments, and then to his office, where
he met for the first time Mr. Gorham, the owner of the
Leighton mortgage, and learned that the place was
really where his father used to live and that the Homestead
was named for the Hallams. This increased his
desire to own it, and, as there was still time to catch
the next train for Boston, he started for the depot and
was soon on his way to Worcester, where he arrived
about four in the afternoon. Wishing to make some
inquiries as to the best means of reaching Leicester,
he went to a hotel, where he found no one in the office
besides the clerk except a tall, spare man, with
long, light hair tinged with gray, and shrewdness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>curiosity written all over his good-humored face. He
wore a linen duster, with no collar, and only an apology
for a handkerchief twisted around his neck. Tipping
back in one chair, with his feet in another, he was
taking frequent and most unsuccessful aims at a cuspidor
about six feet from him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-afternoon,” he said, removing his feet from
the chair for a moment, but soon putting them back, as
he asked if Reginald had just come from the train, and
whether from the East or the West. Then he told him
it was an all-fired hot day, that it looked like thunder in
the west, and he shouldn’t wonder if they got a heavy
shower before night.</p>

<p class='c012'>To all this Reginald assented, and then went to the
desk to register, while the stranger, on pretense of looking
at something in the street, also arose and sauntered
to the door, managing to glance at the register and see
the name just written there.</p>

<p class='c012'>Resuming his seat and inviting Rex to take a chair
near him, he began: “I b’lieve you’re from New York.
I thought so the minute you came in. I have traveled
from Dan to Beersheba, and been through the war,—was
a corp’ral there,—and I generally spot you fellows
when I first put my eye on you. I am Phineas Jones,—Phin
for short. I hain’t any real profession, but am
jack at all trades and good at none. Everybody knows
me in these parts, and I know everybody.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex, who began to be greatly amused with this queer
specimen, bowed an acknowledgment of the honor of
knowing Mr. Jones, who said, “Be you acquainted in
Worcester?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not at all. Was never here before,” was Rex’s reply,
and Phineas continued: “Slow old place, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>think, but I like it. Full of nice folks of all sorts, with
clubs, and lodges, and societies, and no end of squabbles
about temperance and city officers and all that.
As for music,—my land, I’d smile to see any place hold
a candle to us. Had all the crack singers here, even to
the diver.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex, who had listened rather indifferently to Phineas’s
laudations of Worcester, now asked if he knew much of
the adjoining towns,—Leicester, for instance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wa-all, I’d smile,” Phineas replied, with a fierce assault
upon the cuspidor. “Yes, I would smile if I didn’t
know Leicester. Why, I was born there, and it’s always
been my native town, except two or three years in Sturbridge,
when I was a shaver, and the time I was to the
war and travelin’ round. Pleasant town, but dull,—with
no steam cars nigher than Rochdale or Worcester.
Got stages and an electric car to Spencer;—run every
half hour. Think of goin’ there?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex said he did, and asked the best way of getting
there.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wa-all, there’s four ways,—the stage, but that’s
gone; hire a team and drive out,—that’s expensive;
take the steam cars for Rochdale, or Jamesville, and then
drive out,—that’s expensive, too; or take the electric,
which is cheaper, and pleasanter, and quicker. Know
anybody in Leicester?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex said he didn’t, and asked if Phineas knew a place
called Hallam Homestead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wa-all, I’d smile if I didn’t,” Phineas replied.
“Why, I’ve worked in hayin’-time six or seven summers
for Square Leighton. He was ’lected justice of
the peace twelve or fifteen years ago, and I call him
Square yet, as a title seems to suit him, he’s so different-lookin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>from most farmers,—kind of high-toned, you
know. Ort to have been an aristocrat. As to the Hallams,
who used to own the place, I’ve heard of ’em ever
since I was knee-high; I was acquainted with Carter;
first-rate feller. By the way, your name is Hallam.
Any kin?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex explained his relationship to the Hallams, while
the smile habitual to Phineas’s face, and which, with the
expressions he used so often, had given him the <i><span lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i>
of Smiling Phin, broadened into a loud laugh of
genuine delight and surprise, and, springing up, he
grasped Rex’s hand, exclaiming: “This beats the
Dutch! I’m glad to see you, I be. I thought you was
all dead when Carter died. There’s a pile of you in the
old Greenville graveyard. Why, you ’n’ I must be connected.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex looked at him wonderingly, while he went on:
“You see, Carter Hallam’s wife was Lucy Ann Brown,
and her great-grandmother and my great-grandfather
were half-brother and sister. Now, what relation be I
to Lucy Ann, or to you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex confessed his inability to trace so remote a relationship
on so hot a day, and Phineas rejoined:</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tain’t very near, that’s a fact, but we’re related,
though I never thought Lucy Ann hankered much for
my society. I used to call her cousin, which made her
mad. She was a handsome girl when she clerked it
here in Worcester and roped Carter in. A high stepper,—turned
up her nose when I ast her for her company.
That’s when she was bindin’ shoes, before she knew
Carter. I don’t s’pose I could touch her now with a ten-foot
pole, though I b’lieve I’ll call the fust time I’m in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>New York, if you’ll give me your number. Blood is
blood. How is the old lady?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here was a chance for Rex to inquire into his aunt’s
antecedents, of which he knew little, as she was very
reticent with regard to her early life. He knew that
she was an orphan and had no near relatives, and that
she had once lived in Worcester, and that was all. The
clerkship and the shoe-binding were news to him; he
did not even know before that she was Lucy Ann, as
she had long ago dropped the <em>Ann</em> as too plebeian; but,
with the delicacy of a true gentleman, he would not ask
a question of this man, who, he was sure, would tell all
he knew and a great deal more, if urged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder what Aunt Lucy would say to being
visited and cousined by this Yankee, who calls her an
old lady?” he thought, as he said that she was very well
and had just sailed for Europe, adding that she was
still handsome and very young-looking.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You don’t say!” Phineas exclaimed, and began at
once to calculate her age, basing his data on a spelling-school
in Sturbridge when she was twelve years old and
had spelled him down, a circus in Fiskdale which she
had attended with him when she was fifteen, and the
time when he had asked for her company in Worcester.
Naturally, he made her several years older than she
really was.</p>

<p class='c012'>But she was not there to protest, and Rex did not
care. He was more interested in his projected purchase
than in his aunt’s age, and he asked if the Hallam
farm were good or bad.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wa-all, ’taint neither,” Phineas replied. “You see,
it’s pretty much run down for want of means and management.
The Square ain’t no kind of a farmer, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>never was, and he didn’t ort to be one, but his wife persuaded
him. My land, how a woman can twist a man
round her fingers, especially if she’s kittenish and
pretty and soft-spoken, as the Square’s wife was. She
was from Georgy, and nothin’ would do but she must
live on a farm and have it fixed up as nigh like her
father’s plantation as she could. She took down the big
chimbleys and built some outside,—queer-lookin’ till the
woodbine run up and covered ’em clear to the top, and
now they’re pretty. She made a bath-room out of the
but’try, and a but’try out of the meal-room. She
couldn’t have niggers, nor, of course, nigger cabins, but
she got him to build a lot of other out-houses, which
cost a sight,—stables, and a dog-kennel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dog-kennels!” Rex interrupted, feeling more desirous
than ever for a place with kennels already in it.
“How large are they?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There ain’t but one,” Phineas said, “and that ain’t
there now. It was turned into a pig-pen long ago, for
the Square can’t abide dogs; but there’s a hen-house,
and smoke-house, and ice-house, and house over the
well, and flower-garden with box borders, and yard terraced
down to the orchard, with brick walls and steps,
and a dammed brook——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A what?” Reginald asked, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wa-all, I should smile if you thought I meant disrespect
for the Bible; I didn’t. I’m a church member,—a
Free Methodist and class-leader, and great on exhortin’
and experiencin’, they say. I don’t swear. You spelt
the word wrong, with an <em>n</em> instead of two <em>m</em>’s,
that’s what’s the matter. That’s the word your aunt
Lucy Ann spelt me down on at the spellin’-school. We
two stood up longest and were tryin’ for the medal. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>more used to the word with an <em>n</em> in it than I am now, and
got beat. What I mean about the brook is that it runs
acrost the road into the orchard, and Mis’ Leighton had
it dammed up with boards and stones to make a waterfall,
with a rustic bridge below it, and a butternut tree
and a seat under it, where you can set and view nature.
But bless your soul, such things don’t pay, and if Mis’
Leighton had lived she’d of ruined the Square teetotally,
but she died, poor thing, and the Square’s hair turned
white in six months.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What family has Mr. Leighton?” Rex asked, and
Phineas replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two girls, that’s all; one handsome as blazes, like
her mother, and the other—wa’all, she is nice-lookin’,
with a motherly, venerable kind of face that everybody
trusts. She stays to hum, Dorcas does, while——”
Here he was interrupted by Rex, who, more interested
just then in the farm than in the girls, asked if it was
for sale.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For sale?” Phineas replied. “I’d smile to see the
Square sell his farm, though he owes a pile on it; borrows
of Peter to pay Paul, you know, and so keeps a-goin’;
but I don’t believe he’d sell for love nor money.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not if he could get cash down and, say, a thousand
more than it is worth?” Rex suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>Staggered by the thousand dollars, which seemed like
a fortune to one who had never had more than a few
hundred at a time in his life, Phineas gasped:</p>

<p class='c012'>“One thousand extry! Wa-all, I swan, a thousand
extry would tempt some men to sell their souls; but I
don’t know about it fetchin’ the Square. Think of
buyin’ it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex said he did.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“For yourself?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, for myself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>You</em> goin’ to turn farmer?” and Phineas looked him
over from head to foot. “Wa-all, if that ain’t curi’s.
I’d smile to see you, or one of your New York dudes,
a-farmin’ it, with your high collars, your long coats and
wide trouses and yaller shoes and canes and eye-glasses,
and hands that never done a stroke of hard work in
your lives. Yes, I would.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex had never felt so small in his life as when
Phineas was drawing a picture he recognized as tolerably
correct of most of his class, and he half wished his
collar was a trifle lower and his coat a little shorter,
but he laughed good-humoredly and said, “I am afraid
we do seem a useless lot to you, and I suppose we might
wear older-fashioned clothes, but I can’t help the
glasses. I couldn’t see across the street without them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I want to know,” Phineas said. “Wa-all, they ain’t
bad on you, they’re so clear and hain’t no rims to speak
of. They make you look like a literary feller, or more
like a minister. Be you a professor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex flushed a little at the close questioning, expecting
to be asked next how much he was worth and
where his money was invested, but he answered
honestly, “I wish I could say yes, but I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a pity! Come to one of our meetin’s, and
we’ll convert you in no time. What persuasion be
you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Reginald said he was an Episcopalian, and Phineas’s
face fell. He hadn’t much faith in Episcopalians, thinking
their service was mere form, with nothing in it
which he could enjoy, except that he did not have to
sit still long enough to get sleepy, and there were so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>many places where he could come in strong with an
Amen, as he always did. This opinion, however, he
did not express to Reginald. He merely said, “Wa-all,
there’s good folks in every church. I do b’lieve the
Square is pious, and he’s a ’Piscopal. Took it from his
Georgy wife, who had a good many other fads. You
have a good face, like all the Hallams, and I b’lieve
they died in the faith. Says so, anyway, on their tombstones;
but monuments lie as well as obituaries. But
I ain’t a-goin’ to discuss religious tenants, though I’m
fust-rate at it, they say. I want to know what <em>you</em>
want of a farm?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex told him that he had long wished for a place in
the country, where he could spend a part of each year
with a few congenial friends, hunting and fishing and
boating, and from what he had heard of the Homestead,
he thought it would just suit him, there were so
many hills and woods and ponds around it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are there pleasant drives?” he asked, and Phineas
replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tip-top, the city folks think. Woods full of roads
leading nowhere except to some old house a hundred
years old or more, and the older they be the better the
city folks like ’em. Why, they actu’lly go into the garrets
and buy up old spinning-wheels and desks and
chairs; and, my land, they’re crazy over tall clocks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex did not care much for the furniture of the old
garrets unless it should happen to belong to the Hallams,
and he asked next if there were foxes in the
woods, and if he could get up a hunt with dogs and
horses.</p>

<p class='c012'>Phineas did not smile, but laughed long and loud,
and deluged the cuspidor, before he replied:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Wa-all, if I won’t give up! A fox-hunt, with
hounds and horses, tearin’ through the folks’s fields and
gardens! Why, you’d be mobbed. You’d be tarred
and feathered. You’d be rid on a rail.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” Rex exclaimed, “I should keep on my own
premises. A man has a right to do what he pleases
with his own,” a remark which so affected Phineas that
he doubled up with laughter, as he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s so; but, bless your soul, the Homestead
farm ain’t big enough for a hunt. It takes acres and
acres for that, and if you had ’em the foxes wouldn’t
stop to ask if it’s your premises or somebody else’s.
They ain’t likely to take to the open if they can help it,
but with the dogs to their heels and widder Brady’s
garden right before ’em they’d make a run for it. Her
farm jines the Homestead, and ’twould be good as a
circus to see the hounds tearin’ up her sage and her
gooseberries and her violets. She’d be out with brooms
and mops and pokers; and, besides that, the Leicester
women would be up in arms and say ’twas cruel for a
lot of men to hunt a poor fox to death just for fun.
They are great on Bergh, Leicester women are, and
they might arrest you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Reginald saw his fox-hunts fading into air, and was
about to ask what there was in the woods which he
could hunt without fear of the widow Brady or the
Bergh ladies of the town, when Phineas sprang up, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hullo! there’s the Square now. I saw him in town
this mornin’ about some plasterin’ I ort to have done
six weeks ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And he darted from the door, while Rex, looking
from the window, saw an old horse drawing an old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>buggy in which sat an old man, evidently intent upon
avoiding a street-car rapidly approaching him, while
Phineas was making frantic efforts to stop him. But a
car from an opposite direction and a carriage blocked
his way, and by the time these had passed the old man
and buggy were too far up the street for him to be
heard or to overtake them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m awful sorry,” he said, as he returned to the hotel.
“He was alone, and you could of rid with him as well
as not and saved your fare.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex thanked him for his kind intentions, but said he
did not mind the fare in the least and preferred the
electric car. Then, as he wished to look about the city
a little, he bade good-bye to Phineas, who accompanied
him to the door, and said: “Mabby you’d better mention
my name to the Square as a surety that you’re all
right. He hain’t traveled as much as I have, nor seen
as many swells like you, and he might take you for a
confidence man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex promised to make use of his new friend if he
found it necessary, and walked away, while Phineas
looked after him admiringly, thinking, “That’s a fine
chap; not a bit stuck up. Glad I’ve met him, for now
I shall visit Lucy Ann when she comes home. He’s a
little off, though, on his farm and his fox-hunts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, Reginald walked through several streets,
and at last found himself in the vicinity of the electric
car, which he took for Leicester. It was a pleasant
ride, and he enjoyed it immensely, especially after they
were out in the country and began to climb the long
hill. At his request he was put down at the cross-road
and the gabled house pointed out to him. Very eagerly
he looked about him as he went slowly up the avenue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>or lane bordered with cherry-trees on one side, and on
the other commanding an unobstructed view of the
country for miles around, with its valleys and thickly
wooded hills.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is charming,” he said, as he turned his attention
next to the house and its surroundings.</p>

<p class='c012'>How quiet and pleasant it looked, with its gables and
picturesque chimneys under the shadow of the big
apple-tree in the rear and the big elm in the front! He
could see the out-buildings of which Phineas had told
him,—the well-house, the hen-house, the smoke-house,
the ice-house and stable,—and could hear the faint sound
of the brook in the orchard falling over the dam into
the basin below.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish I had lived here when a boy, as my father
and uncle did,” he thought, just as a few big drops of
rain fell upon the grass, and he noticed for the first
time how black it was overhead, and how threatening
were the clouds rolling up so fast from the west.</p>

<p class='c012'>It had been thundering at intervals ever since he left
Worcester, and in the sultry air there was that stillness
which portends the coming of a severe storm. But he
had paid no attention to it, and now he did not hasten
his steps until there came a deafening crash of thunder,
followed instantaneously by a drenching downpour of
rain, which seemed to come in sheets rather than in
drops, and he knew that in a few minutes he would be
wet through, as his coat was rather thin and he had no
umbrella. He was still some little distance from the
house, but by running swiftly he was soon under the
shelter of the piazza, and knocking at the door, with a
hope that it might be opened by the girl who Phineas
had said “was handsome as blazes.”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>REX AT THE HOMESTEAD.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The day had been longer and lonelier to Dorcas than
the previous one, for then she had gone with Bertha to
the train in Worcester, and after saying good-bye, had
done some shopping in town and made a few calls before
returning home. She had then busied herself with
clearing up Bertha’s room, which was not an altogether
easy task. Bertha was never as orderly as her sister,
and, in the confusion of packing, her room was in a
worse condition than usual. But to clear it up was a
labor of love, over which Dorcas lingered as long as
possible. Then when all was done and she had closed
the shutters and dropped the shades, she knelt by the
white bed and amid a rain of tears prayed God to protect
the dear sister on sea and land and bring her safely
back to the home which was so desolate without her.
That was yesterday; but to-day there had been comparatively
nothing to do, for after an early breakfast
her father had started for Boylston, hoping to collect a
debt which had long been due and the payment of
which would help towards the mortgage. After he
had gone and her morning work was done, Dorcas sat
down alone in the great, lonely house and began to cry,
wondering what she should do to pass the long hours
before her father’s return.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish I had Bertha’s room to straighten up again,”
she thought. “Any way I’ll go and look at it.” And,
drying her eyes, she went up to the room, which seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>so dark and close and gloomy that she opened the
windows and threw back the blinds, letting in the full
sunlight and warm summer air. “She was fond of air
and sunshine,” she said to herself, remembering the
many times they had differed on that point, she insisting
that so much sun faded the carpets, and Bertha
insisting that she would have it, carpets or no carpets.
Bertha was fond of flowers, too, and in their season kept
the house full of them. This Dorcas also remembered,
and, going to the garden, she gathered great clusters of
roses and white lilies, which she arranged in two
bouquets, putting one on the bureau and the other on
the deep window-seat, where Bertha used to sit so often
when at home, and where one of her favorite books was
lying, with her work-basket and a bit of embroidery she
had played at doing. The book and the basket Dorcas
had left on the window-seat with something of the feeling
which prompts us to keep the rooms of our dead as
they left them. At the side of the bed and partly under
it she had found a pair of half-worn slippers, which
Bertha was in the habit of wearing at night while undressing,
and these she had also left, they looked so
much like Bertha, with their worn toes and high French
heels. Now as she saw them she thought to put them
away, but decided to leave them, as it was not likely
any one would occupy the room in Bertha’s absence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There, it looks more cheerful now,” she said, surveying
the apartment with its sunlight and flowers.
Then, going down-stairs she whiled away the hours as
best she could until it was time to prepare supper for
her father, whose coming she watched for anxiously,
hoping he would reach home before the storm which
was fast gathering in the west and sending out flashes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of lightning, with angry growls of thunder. “He will
be hungry and tired, and I mean to give him his favorite
dishes,” she thought, as she busied herself in the
kitchen. With a view to make his home-coming as
pleasant as possible, she laid the table with the best
cloth and napkins and the gilt band china, used only on
great occasions, and put on a plate for Bertha, and a
bowl of roses in the centre, with one or two buds at each
plate, “Now, that looks nice,” she thought, surveying
her work, with a good deal of satisfaction, “and father
will be pleased. I wish he would come. How black
the sky is getting, and how angry the clouds look!”
Then she thought of Bertha on the sea, and wondered
if the storm would reach her, and was silently praying
that it would not, when she saw old Bush and the buggy
pass the windows, and in a few moments her father
came in looking very pale and tired. He had had a
long ride for nothing, as the man who owed him could
not pay, but he brightened at once when he saw the
attractive tea-table and divined why all the best things
were out.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are a good girl, Dorcas, and I don’t know what
I should do without you now,” he said, stroking Dorcas’s
hair caressingly, and adding, “Now let us have supper.
I am hungry as a bear, as Bertha would say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorcas started to leave the room just as she heard the
sound of the bell and knew the electric car was coming
up the hill. Though she had seen it so many times, she
always stopped to look at it, and she stopped now and
saw Reginald alight from it and saw the conductor
point towards their house as if directing him to it.
“Who can it be?” she thought, calling her father to the
window, where they both stood watching the stranger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>as he came slowly along the avenue. “How queerly he
acts, stopping so much to look around! Don’t he know
it is beginning to rain?” she said, just as the crash and
downpour came which sent Rex flying towards the
house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, father!” Dorcas exclaimed, clutching his arm,
“don’t you know, Mr. Gorham wrote that the New
Yorker who wanted to buy our farm might come to
look at it? I believe this is he. What shall we do with
him? Bertha told us to shut the door in his face.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You would hardly keep a dog out in a storm like
this. Why, I can’t see across the road. I never knew
it rain so fast,” Mr. Leighton replied, as Rex’s knock
sounded on the door, which Dorcas opened just as a
vivid flash of lightning lit up the sky and was followed
instantaneously by a deafening peal of thunder and a
dash of rain which swept half-way down the hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, my!” Dorcas said, holding back her dress; and
“Great Scott!” Rex exclaimed, as he sprang inside and
helped her close the door. Then, turning to her, he
said, with a smile which disarmed her at once of any
prejudice she might have against him, “I beg your
pardon for coming in so unceremoniously. I should
have been drenched in another minute. Does Mr.
Leighton live here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorcas said he did, and, opening a door to her right,
bade him enter. Glancing in, Rex felt sure it was the
best room, and drew back, saying, apologetically, “I
am not fit to go in there, or indeed to go anywhere. I
believe I am wet to the skin. Look,” and he pointed to
the little puddles of water which had dripped from his
coat and were running over the floor.</p>

<p class='c012'>His concern was so genuine, and the eyes so kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>which looked at Dorcas, that he did not seem like a
stranger, and she said to him, “I should say you were
wet. You’d better take off your coat and let me dry it
by the kitchen fire or you will take cold.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She <em>is</em> a motherly little girl, as Phineas Jones said,”
Rex thought, feeling sure that this was not the one
who was “handsome as blazes,” but the nice one, who
thought of everything, and if his first smile had not
won her his second would have done so, as he said,
“Thanks. You are very kind, but I’ll not trouble you
to do that, and perhaps I’d better introduce myself. I
am Reginald Hallam, from New York, and my father
used to live here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh-h!” Dorcas exclaimed, her fear of the dreaded
stranger who was coming to buy their farm vanishing
at once, while she wondered in a vague way where she
had heard the name before, but did not associate it
with Louie Thurston’s hero, of whom Bertha had told
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was one of the Hallams, of whom the old people
in town thought so much, and it was natural that he
should wish to see the old Homestead. At this point
Mr. Leighton came into the hall and was introduced to
the stranger, whom he welcomed cordially, while
Dorcas, with her hospitable instincts in full play, again
insisted that he should remove his wet coat and shoes
before he took cold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are a little damp, that’s a fact; but what can
I do without them?” Reginald replied, beginning to feel
very uncomfortable, and knowing that in all probability
a sore throat would be the result of his bath.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll tell you,” Dorcas said, looking at her father.
“He can wear the dressing-gown and slippers Bertha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>gave you last Christmas.” And before Rex could stop
her she was off up-stairs in her father’s bedroom, from
which she returned with a pair of Turkish slippers and
a soft gray cashmere dressing-gown with dark blue velvet
collar and cuffs.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Father never wore them but a few times; he says
they are too fine,” she said to Rex, who, much against
his will, soon found himself arrayed in Mr. Leighton’s
gown and slippers, while Dorcas carried his wet coat and
shoes in triumph to the kitchen fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, this is a lark,” Rex thought as he caught sight
of himself in the glass. “I wonder what Phineas Jones
would say if he knew that instead of being taken for a
confidence man I’m received as a son and a brother and
dressed up in ‘the Square’s’ best clothes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Supper was ready by this time, and without any demur,
which he knew would be useless, Rex sat down to
the table which Dorcas had made so pretty, rejoicing
now that she had done so, wondering if their guest
would notice it, and feeling glad that he was in Bertha’s
chair. He did notice everything, and especially the
flowers and the extra seat, which he occupied, and which
he knew was not put there for him, but probably for
the handsome girl, who would come in when the storm
was over, and he found himself thinking more of her
than of the blessing which Mr. Leighton asked so reverently,
adding a petition that God would care for the
loved one wherever and in whatever danger she might
be.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maybe that’s the girl; but where the dickens can
she be that she’s in danger?” Rex thought, just as a
clap of thunder louder than any which had preceded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>it shook the house and made Dorcas turn pale as she
said to her father:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, do you suppose it will reach her?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think not,” Mr. Leighton replied; then turning to
Rex, he said, “My youngest daughter, Bertha, is on the
sea,—sailed on the Teutonic this morning,—and Dorcas
is afraid the storm may reach her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sailed this morning on the Teutonic!” Rex repeated.
“So did my aunt, Mrs. Carter Hallam.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Carter Hallam!” and Dorcas set down her cup
of tea with such force that some of it was spilled upon the
snowy cloth. “Why, that is the name of the lady with
whom Bertha has gone as companion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Rex’s turn now to be surprised, and explanations
followed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I supposed all the Hallams of Leicester were dead,
and never thought of associating Mrs. Carter with
them,” Mr. Leighton said, while Rex in turn explained
that as Miss Leighton’s letter had been written in Boston
and he had addressed her there for his aunt it did
not occur to him that her home was here at the Homestead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you see her on the ship, and was she well?”
Dorcas asked, and he replied that, as he reached the
steamer only in time to say good-bye to his aunt, he did
not see Miss Leighton, but he knew she was there and
presumably well.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am sorry now that I did not meet her,” he added,
looking more closely at Dorcas than he had done before,
and trying to trace some resemblance between her and
the photograph he had dubbed Squint-Eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>But there was none, and he felt a good deal puzzled,
wondering what Phineas meant by calling Dorcas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“handsome as blazes.” She must be the one referred
to, for no human being could ever accuse Squint-Eye of
any degree of beauty. And yet how the father and sister
loved her, and how the old man’s voice trembled
when he spoke of her, always with pride it seemed to
Rex, who began at last himself to feel a good deal of
interest in her. He knew now that he was occupying
her seat, and that the rose-bud he had fastened in his
button-hole was put there for her, and he hoped his
aunt would treat her well.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I mean to write and give her some points, for there’s
no guessing what Mrs. Walker Haynes may put her up
to do,” he thought, just as he caught the name of
Phineas and heard Mr. Leighton saying to Dorcas:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I saw him this morning, and he thinks he will get
up in the course of a week and do the plastering.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not before a week! How provoking!” Dorcas replied,
while Rex ventured to say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you speaking of Phineas Jones? I made his
acquaintance this morning, or rather he made mine.
Quite a character, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should say he was,” Dorcas replied, while her
father rejoined:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everybody knows Phineas, and everybody likes
him. He is nobody’s enemy but his own, and shiftlessness
is his great fault. He can do almost everything,
and do it well, too. He’ll work a few weeks,—maybe a
few months,—and then lie idle, visiting and talking, till
he has spent all he earned. He knows everybody’s
business and history, and will sacrifice everything for
his friends. He attends every camp-meeting he can
hear of, and is apt to lose his balance and have what he
calls the power. He comes here quite often, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>very handy in fixing up. I’ve got a little job waiting
for him now, where the plastering fell off in the front
chamber, and I dare say it will continue to wait. But
I like the fellow, and am sorry for him. I don’t know
that he has a relative in the world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex could have told of his Aunt Lucy, and that
through her, Phineas claimed relationship to himself,
but concluded not to open up a subject which he knew
would be obnoxious to his aunt. Supper was now over,
but the rain was still falling heavily, and when Rex
asked how far it was to the hotel, both Mr. Leighton
and Dorcas invited him so cordially to spend the night
with them, that he decided to do so, and then began to
wonder how he should broach the real object of his visit.
From all Phineas had told him, and from what
he had seen of Mr. Leighton, he began to be doubtful of
success, but it was worth trying for, and he was ready
to offer fifteen hundred dollars extra, if necessary. His
coat and shoes were dry by this time, and habited in
them he felt more like himself, and after Dorcas had
removed her apron, showing that her evening work was
done, and had taken her seat near her father, he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the way, did Mr. Gorham ever write to you that
a New Yorker would like to buy your farm?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mr. Leighton replied, and Rex continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am the man, and that is my business here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” and Dorcas moved uneasily in her chair,
while her father answered, “I thought so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there was a silence, which Rex finally broke,
telling why he wanted that particular farm and what he
was willing to give for it, knowing before he finished
that he had failed. The farm was not for sale, except
under compulsion, which Mr. Leighton hoped might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>avoided, explaining matters so minutely that Rex had a
tolerably accurate knowledge of the state of affairs and
knew why the daughter had gone abroad as his aunt’s
companion, in preference to remaining in the employ of
Swartz &#38; Co.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Confound it, if I hadn’t insisted upon aunt’s offering
five hundred instead of three hundred, as she proposed
doing, Bertha would not have gone, and I might have
got the place,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Leighton continued, “I think it would kill me
to lose the home where I have lived so long, but if it
must be sold, I’d rather you should have it than any one
I know, and if worst comes to worst, and anything happens
to Bertha, I’ll let you know in time to buy it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked so white and his voice shook so as he talked
that Rex felt his castles and fox-hunts all crumbling
together, and, with his usual impulsiveness, began to
wonder if Mr. Leighton would accept aid from him in
case of an emergency. It was nearly ten o’clock by this
time, and Mr. Leighton said, “I suppose this is early for
city folks, but in the country we retire early, and I am
tired. We always have prayers at night. Bring the
books, daughter, and we’ll sing the 267th hymn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorcas did as she was bidden, and, offering a Hymnal
to Rex, opened an old-fashioned piano and began to play
and sing, accompanied by her father, whose trembling
voice quavered along until he reached the words,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee</div>
      <div class='line'>For those in peril on the sea.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Then he broke down entirely, while Dorcas soon followed,
and Rex was left to finish alone, which he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>without the slightest hesitancy. He had a rich tenor
voice; taking up the air where Dorcas dropped it, he
sang the hymn to the end, while Mr. Leighton stood
with closed eyes and a rapt expression on his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish Bertha could hear that. Let us pray,” he
said, when the song was ended, and, before he quite
knew what he was doing, Rex found himself on his
knees, listening to Mr. Leighton’s fervent prayer, which
closed with the petition for the safety of those upon the
deep.</p>

<p class='c012'>As Rex had told Phineas Jones, he was not a professor,
and he did not call himself a very religious man. He
attended church every Sunday morning with his aunt,
went through the services reverently, and listened to
the sermon attentively, but not all the splendors of St.
Thomas’s Church had ever impressed him as did that
simple, homely service in the farm house among the
Leicester hills, where his “Amen” to the prayer for
those upon the sea was loud and distinct, and included
in it not only his aunt and Bertha, but also the girl
whom he had knocked down, who seemed to haunt him
strangely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I were to have much of this, Phineas would not be
obliged to take me to one of his meetings to convert
me,” he thought, as he arose from his knees and signified
his readiness to retire.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>REX MAKES DISCOVERIES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was Mr. Leighton who conducted Rex to his sleeping-room,
saying, as he put the lamp down upon the
dressing-bureau: “There’s a big patch of plaster off in
the best chamber, where the girls put company, so you
are to sleep in here. This is Bertha’s room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex became interested immediately. To occupy a
young girl’s room, even if that girl were Squint-Eye,
was a novel experience, and after Mr. Leighton had said
good-night he began to look about with a good deal of
curiosity. Everything was plain, but neat and dainty,
from the pretty matting and soft fur rug on the floor, to
the bed which looked like a white pin-cushion, with its
snowy counterpane and fluted pillow-shams.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is just the room a nice kind of a girl would be
apt to have, and it doesn’t seem as if a great, hulking
fellow like me ought to be in it,” he said, fancying he
could detect a faint perfume such as he knew some girls
affected. “I think, though, it’s the roses and lilies. I
don’t believe Squint-Eye goes in for Lubin and Pinaud
and such like,” he thought, just as he caught sight of the
slippers, which Dorcas had forgotten to remove when
she arranged the room for him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Halloo! here are Cinderella’s shoes, as I live,” he
said, taking one of them up and handling it gingerly as if
afraid he should break it. “French heels; and, by Jove,
she’s got a small foot, and a well-shaped one, too. I
wouldn’t have thought that of Squint-Eye,” he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>with a feeling that the girl he called Squint-Eye had
no right either in the room or in the slipper, which he
put down carefully, and then continued his investigations,
coming next to the window-seat, where the work-basket
and book were lying. “Embroiders, I see.
Wouldn’t be a woman if she didn’t,” he said, as he
glanced at the bit of fancy work left in the basket.
Then his eye caught the book, which he took up and
saw was a volume of Tennyson, which showed a
good deal of usage. “Poetical, too! Wouldn’t have
thought that of her, either. She doesn’t look it.” Then
turning to the fly-leaf, he read, “Bertha Leighton.
From her cousin Louie. Christmas, 18—.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By George,” he exclaimed, “that is Louie Thurston’s
handwriting. Not quite as scrawly as it was
when we wrote the girl and boy letters to each other,
but the counterpart of the note she sent me last summer
in Saratoga, asking me to ride with her and Fred.
And she calls herself cousin to this Bertha! I remember
now she once told me she had some relatives North.
They must be these Leightons, and I have come here to
find them and aunt’s companion too. Truly the world
is very small. Poor little Louie! I don’t believe she
is happy. No woman could be that with Fred, if he <em>is</em>
my friend. Poor little Louie!”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a world of pathos and pity in Rex’s voice
as he said, “Poor little Louie!” and stood looking at
her handwriting and thinking of the beautiful girl whom
he might perhaps have won for his own. But if any
regret for what might have been mingled with his
thoughts, he gave no sign of it, except that the expression
of his face was a shade more serious as he put the
book back in its place and prepared for bed, where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>lay awake a long time, thinking of Louie, and Squint-Eye,
and the girl he had knocked down on the ship, and
Rose Arabella Jefferson, whose face was the last he remembered
before going to sleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next morning was bright and fair, with no trace
of the storm visible except in the freshened foliage and
the puddles of water standing here and there in the road,
and Rex, as he looked from his window upon the green
hills and valleys, felt a pang of disappointment that the
place he so coveted could never be his. Breakfast was
waiting when he went down to the dining-room, and
while at the table he spoke of Louie and asked if she
were not a cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes,” Dorcas said, quickly, a little proud of this
grand relation. “Louie’s mother and ours were sisters.
She told Bertha she knew you. Isn’t she lovely?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex said she was lovely, and that he had known her
since she was a child, and had been in college with her
husband. Then he changed the conversation by inquiring
about the livery-stables in town. He would like,
he said, to drive about the neighborhood a little before
returning to New York, and see the old cemetery
where so many Hallams were buried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Horses enough, but you’ve got to walk into town to
get them. If old Bush will answer your purpose you
are quite welcome to him,” Mr. Leighton said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks,” Rex replied. “I am already indebted to
you for so much that I may as well be indebted for
more. I will take old Bush, and perhaps Miss Leighton
will go with me as a guide.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This Dorcas was quite willing to do, and the two were
soon driving together through the leafy woods and
pleasant roads and past the old houses, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>people came to the doors and windows to see what fine
gentleman Dorcas Leighton had with her. Every one
whom they met spoke to Dorcas and inquired for
Bertha, in whom all seemed greatly interested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your sister must be very popular. This is the
thirteenth person who has stopped you to ask for her,”
Rex said, as an old Scotchman finished his inquiries by
saying, “She’s a bonnie lassie, God bless her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is popular, and deservedly so. I wish you
knew her,” was Dorcas’s reply; and then as a conviction,
born he knew not when or why, kept increasing in
Rex’s mind, he asked, “Would you mind telling me
how she looks? Is she dark or fair? tall or short? fat
or lean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorcas answered unhesitatingly, “She is very beautiful,—neither
fat nor lean, tall nor short, dark nor fair,
but just right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh-h!” and Rex drew a long breath as Dorcas went
on: “She has a lovely complexion, with brilliant color,
perfect features, reddish-brown hair with glints of gold
in it in the sunlight, and the handsomest eyes you ever
saw,—large and bright and almost black at times when
she is excited or pleased,—long lashes, and carries herself
like a queen.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh-h!” Rex said again, knowing that Rose Arabella
Jefferson had fallen from her pedestal of beauty and
was really the Squint-Eye of whom he had thought so
derisively. “Have you a photograph of her?” he asked,
and Dorcas replied that she had and would show it to
him if he liked.</p>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached home, and, bringing out an old
and well-filled album, Dorcas pointed to a photograph
which Rex recognized as a facsimile of the one his aunt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>had insisted belonged to Miss Jefferson. He could not
account for the peculiar sensations which swept over
him and kept deepening in intensity as he looked at the
face which attracted him more now than when he believed
it that of Rose Arabella of Scotsburg.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish you would let me have this. I am a regular
photo-fiend,—have a stack of them at home, and would
like mightily to add this to the lot,” he said, remembering
that the one he had was defaced with Rose Arabella’s
name.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Dorcas declined. “Bertha would not like it,”
she said, taking the album from him quickly, as if she
read his thoughts and feared lest he would take the
picture whether she were willing or not.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was now time for Rex to go, if he would catch the
next car for Worcester. After thanking Mr. Leighton
and Dorcas for their hospitality and telling them to be
sure and let him know whenever they came to New
York, so that he might return their kindness, he bade
them good-bye, with a feeling that although he had lost
his fancy farm and fox-hunts, he had gained two valuable
friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are about the nicest people I ever met,” he
said, as he walked down the avenue. “Couldn’t have
done more if I had been related. I ought to have told
them to come straight to our house if they were
ever in New York, and I would if it were mine. But
Aunt Lucy wouldn’t like it. I wonder she didn’t tell
me about the mistake in the photographs when I was
on the ship. Maybe she didn’t think of it, I saw her so
short a time. I remember, though, that she did say
that Miss Leighton was rather too high and mighty,
and, by George, I told her to sit down on her! I <em>have</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>made a mess of it; but I will write at once and go over
sooner than I intended, for there is no telling what
Mrs. Haynes may put my aunt up to do. I will not
have that girl snubbed; and if I find them at it,
I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here he gave an energetic flourish of his cane in the
air to attract the conductor of the fast-coming car, and
posterity will never know what he intended doing to
his aunt and Mrs. Walker Haynes, if he found them
snubbing that girl.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>AT AIX-LES-BAINS.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>There was a stop of a few days at the Metropole in
London, where Mrs. Hallam engaged a courier; there
was another stop at the Grand in Paris, where a ladies’
maid was secured; and, thus equipped, Mrs. Hallam
felt that she was indeed traveling <i><span lang="fr">en prince</span></i> as she
journeyed on to Aix, where Mrs. Walker Haynes met
her at the station with a very handsome turnout, which
was afterwards included in Mrs. Hallam’s bill.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I knew you would not care to go in the ’bus with
your servants, so I ventured to order the carriage for
you,” she said, as they wound up the steep hill to the
Hôtel Splendide.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she told what she had done for her friend’s comfort
and the pleasure it had been to do it, notwithstanding
all the trouble and annoyance she had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>subjected to. The season was at its height, and all the
hotels were crowded, especially the Splendide. A
grande duchesse with her suite occupied the guestrooms
on the first floor; the King of Greece had all the
second floor south of the main entrance; while English,
Jews, Spaniards, Greeks, and Russians had the rooms
at the other end of the hall; consequently Mrs. Hallam
must be content with the third floor, where a salon and
a bedchamber, with balcony attached, had been reserved
for her. She had found the most trouble with
the salon, she said, as a French countess was determined
to have it, and she had secured it only by engaging it
at once two weeks ago and promising more per day
than the countess was willing to give for it. As it had
to be paid for whether occupied or not, she had taken
the liberty to use it herself, knowing her friend would
not care. Mrs. Hallam didn’t care, even when later on
she found that the salon had been accredited to her
since she first wrote to Mrs. Haynes that she was coming
and asked her to secure rooms. She was accustomed
to being fleeced by Mrs. Haynes, whom Rex
called a second Becky Sharp. The salon business being
settled, Mrs. Haynes ventured farther and said that as
she had been obliged to dismiss her maid and had had
so much trouble to fill her place she had finally decided
to wait until her friend came, when possibly the services
of one maid would answer for both ladies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gracie prefers to wait upon herself,” she continued,
“but I find it convenient at times to have some one do
my hair and lay out my dresses and go with me to the
baths, which I take about ten; you, no doubt, who have
plenty of money, will go down early in one of those
covered chairs which two men bring to your room.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>It is a most comfortable way of doing, as you are
wrapped in a blanket quite <i><span lang="fr">en déshabille</span></i> and put into a
chair, the curtains are dropped, and you are taken to
the bath and back in time for your first <i><span lang="fr">déjeûner</span></i>, and are
all through with the baths early and can enjoy yourself
the rest of the day. It is rather expensive, of course,
and I cannot afford it, but all who can, do. The Scrantoms
from New York, the Montgomerys from Boston,
the Harwoods from London, and old Lady Gresham, all
go down that way; quite a high-toned procession,
which some impertinent American girls try to kodak.
I shall introduce you to these people. They know you
are coming, and you are sure to like them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Haynes knew just what chord to touch with her
ambitious friend, who was as clay in her hands. By
the time the hotel was reached it had been arranged
that she was not only to continue to use the salon, but
was also welcome to the services of Mrs. Hallam’s maid,
Celine, and her courier, Browne, and possibly her companion,
although on this point she was doubtful, as the
girl had a mind of her own and was not easily managed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I saw that in her face the moment I looked at her,
and thought she might give you trouble. She really
looked as if she expected me to speak to her. Who is
she?” Mrs. Haynes asked, and very briefly Mrs. Hallam
told all she knew of her,—of the mistake in the photographs,
of Reginald’s admiration of the one which was
really Bertha’s, and of his encounter with her on the
ship.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hm; yes,” Mrs. Walker rejoined, reflectively, and
in an instant her tactics were resolved upon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Possessed of a large amount of worldly wisdom and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>foresight, she boasted that she could read the end from
the beginning, and on this occasion her quick instincts
told her that, given a chance, this hired companion
might come between her and her plan of marrying her
daughter Grace to Rex Hallam, who was every way
desirable as a son-in-law. She had seen enough of him
to know that if he cared for a girl it would make no difference
whether she were a wage-earner or the daughter
of a duke, and Bertha might prove a formidable rival.
He had admired her photograph and been kind to her
on the boat, and when he met her again there was no
knowing what complications might arise if, as was most
probable, Bertha herself were artful and ambitious.
And so, for no reason whatever except her own petty
jealousy, she conceived a most unreasonable dislike for
the girl; and when Mrs. Haynes was unreasonable she
sometimes was guilty of acts of which she was afterwards
ashamed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Arrived at the hotel, which the ’bus had reached
before her, she said to Bertha, who was standing near
the door, “Take your mistress’s bag and shawl up to
the third floor, No. —, and wait there for us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha knew it was Celine’s place to do this, but that
demoiselle, who thus far had not proved the treasure
she was represented to be, had found an acquaintance,
to whom she was talking so volubly that she did not
observe the entrance of her party until Bertha was half-way
up the three flights of stairs, with Mrs. Hallam’s
bag and wrap as well as her own. The service at the
Splendide was not the best, and those who would wait
upon themselves were welcome to do so, and Bertha toiled
on with her arms full, while Mrs. Hallam and Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Haynes took the little coop of a lift and ascended very
leisurely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is your room. I hope you will like it,” Mrs.
Haynes said, stopping at the open door of a large, airy
room, with a broad window opening upon a balcony,
where a comfortable easy-chair was standing. Mrs.
Hallam sank into it at once, admiring the view and
pleased with everything. The clerk at the office had
handed her a letter which had come in the morning
mail. It was from Rex, and was full of his visit to the
Homestead, the kindness he had received from Mr.
Leighton and Dorcas, and the discovery he had made
with regard to Bertha.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder you didn’t tell me on the ship that I was
right and you wrong,” he wrote. “You did say, though,
that she was high and mighty, and I told you to sit on her.
But don’t you do it! She is a lady by birth and education,
and I want you to treat her kindly and not let Mrs.
Haynes bamboozle you into snubbing her because she is
your companion. I sha’n’t like it if you do, for it will be
an insult to the Leightons and a shame to us.” Then
he added, “At the hotel in Worcester I fell in with a
fellow who claimed to be a fortieth cousin of yours,
Phineas Jones. Do you remember him? Great character.
Called you cousin Lucy Ann,—said you spelled
him down at a spelling-match on the word ‘dammed,’
and that he was going to call when you got home. I
didn’t give him our address.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After reading this the view from the balcony did not
look so charming or the sunlight so bright, and there
was a shadow on Mrs. Hallam’s face caused not so much
by what Rex had written of the Homestead as by his
encounter with Phineas Jones, her abomination. Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>had he, of all possible persons, turned up? And what
else had he told Rex of her besides the spelling
episode? Everything, probably, and more than everything,
for she remembered well Phineas’s loquacity,
which sometimes carried him into fiction. And he
talked of calling upon her, too! “The wretch!” she
said, crushing the letter in her hands, as she would have
liked to crush the offending Phineas.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No bad news, I hope?” Mrs. Haynes said, stepping
upon the balcony and noting the change in her friend’s
expression.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Hallam, who would have died sooner than tell
of Phineas Jones, answered, “Oh, no. Rex has been
to the Homestead and found out about Bertha, over
whom he is wilder than ever, saying I must be kind to
her and all that; as if I would be anything else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hm; yes,” Mrs. Haynes replied, an expression which
always meant a great deal with her, and which in this
case meant a greater dislike to Bertha and a firmer
resolve to humiliate her.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was beginning to grow dark by this time. Reentering
her room, Mrs. Hallam asked, “Where is
Celine? I want her to open my trunk and get out a
cooler dress; this is so hot and dusty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Celine was not forthcoming, and Bertha was
summoned in her place. At the Metropole Bertha had
occupied a stuffy little room looking into a court, while
at the Grand in Paris she had slept in what she called a
closet, so that now she felt as if in Paradise when she
took possession of her room, which, if small and at the
rear, looked out upon grass and flowers and the tall
hills which encircle Aix on all sides.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is delightful,” she thought, as she leaned from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the window inhaling the perfume of the flowers and
drinking in the sweet, pure air which swept down the
green hillside, where vines and fruits were growing.
She, too, had found a letter waiting for her from
Dorcas, who detailed every particular of Reginald’s
visit to the Homestead, and dwelt at some length upon
his evident admiration of Bertha’s photograph and his
desire to have it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t pretend to have your psychological presentiments,”
Dorcas wrote, “but if I had I should say that
Mr. Hallam would admire you when he sees you quite
as much as he did your picture, and I know you will
like him. You cannot help it. He will join you before
long.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha knew better than Dorcas that she should like
Rex Hallam, and something told her that her life after
he came would be different from what it was now. For
Mrs. Hallam she had but little respect, she was so
thoroughly selfish and exacting, but she did not dislike
her with the dislike she had conceived in a moment for
Mrs. Haynes, in whom she had intuitively recognized a
foe, who would tyrannize over and humiliate her worse
than her employer. During her climb up-stairs she had
resolved upon her course of conduct towards the lady
should she attempt to browbeat her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will do my best to please Mrs. Hallam, but I will
not be subject to that woman,” she thought, just as
some one knocked, and in response to her “Come in,”
Mrs. Haynes appeared, saying, “Leighton, Mrs. Hallam
wants you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Madam, if you are speaking to me, I am <em>Miss Leighton</em>,”
Bertha said, while her eyes flashed so angrily that
for a moment Mrs. Haynes lost her self command and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>stammered an apology, saying she was so accustomed
to hearing the English employees called by their last
names that she had inadvertently acquired the habit.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a haughty inclination of Bertha’s head in
token that she accepted the apology, and then the two,
between whom there was now war, went to Mrs. Hallam’s
room, where Bertha unlocked a trunk and took
out a fresher dress. While she was doing this, Mrs.
Hallam again stepped out upon the balcony with Mrs.
Haynes, who said;</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is too late for <i><span lang="fr">table d’hôte</span></i>, but I have ordered a
nice little extra dinner for you and me, to be served in
our salon. I thought you’d like it better there the first
night. Grace has dined and gone to the Casino with a
party of English, who have rooms under us. The king
is to be there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know him well?” Mrs. Hallam asked, pleased
at the possibility of hobnobbing with royalty.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ye-es—no-o. Well, he has bowed to me, but I have
not exactly spoken to him yet,” was Mrs. Haynes’s reply,
and then she went on hurriedly, “I have engaged
seats for lunch and dinner for you, Grace and myself
in the <i><span lang="fr">salle-à-manger</span></i>, near Lady Gresham’s party, and
also a small table in a corner of the breakfast-room
where we can be quite private and take our coffee together,
when you do not care to have it in your salon.
Grace insists upon going down in the morning, and of
course, I must go with her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are very kind,” Mrs. Hallam said, thinking
how nice it was to have all care taken from her, while
Mrs. Haynes continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your servants take their meals in the servants’
hall. Celine will naturally prefer to sit with her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>people, and if you like I will arrange to have places reserved
with the English for your courier and—and——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She hesitated a little, until Mrs. Hallam said, in some
surprise:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you mean Miss Leighton?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she went on. “Yes, the courier and Miss
Leighton; he seems a very respectable man,—quite
superior to his class.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here was a turn in affairs for which even Mrs. Hallam
was not prepared. Heretofore Bertha had taken
her meals with her, nor had she thought of a change;
but if Mrs. Walker Haynes saw fit to make one, it must
be right. Still, there was Rex to be considered.
Would he think this was treating Bertha as she should
be treated? She was afraid not, and she said, hesitatingly,
“Yes, but I am not sure Reginald would like it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What has he to do with it, pray?” Mrs. Haynes
asked, quickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Hallam replied, “Her family was very nice to
him, and you know he wrote me to treat her kindly. I
don’t think he would like to find her in the servants’
hall.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was the first sign of rebellion Mrs. Haynes had
ever seen in her friend, and she met it promptly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do not see how you can do differently, if you adhere
to the customs of those with whom you wish to
associate. Several English families have had companions,
or governesses, or seamstresses, or something,
and they have always gone to the servants’ hall. Lady
Gresham has one there now. Miss Leighton may be
all Reginald thinks she is, but if she puts herself in the
position of an employee she must expect an employee’s
fare, and not thrust herself upon first-class people.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>You will only pay second-class for her if she goes
there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Lady Gresham and the English and paying second-class
were influencing Mrs. Hallam mightily, but a
dread of Rex, who when roused in the cause of oppression
would not be pleasant to meet, kept her hesitating,
until Bertha herself settled the matter. She had heard
the conversation, although it had been carried on in low
tones and sometimes in whispers. At first she resolved
that rather than submit to this indignity she would give
up her position and go home; then, remembering what
Mrs. Hallam had said of Reginald, who was sure to be
angry if he found her thus humiliated, she began to
change her mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll do it,” she thought, while the absurdity of the
thing grew upon her so fast that it began at last to look
like a huge joke which she might perhaps enjoy.
Going to the door, she said, while a proud smile played
over her face, “Ladies, I could not help hearing what
you said, and as Mrs. Hallam seems undecided in the
matter I will decide for her, and go to the servants’
hall, which I prefer. I have tried first-class people, and
would like a chance to try the second.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She looked like a young queen as she stood in the
doorway, her eyes sparkling and her cheeks glowing
with excitement, and Mrs. Haynes felt that for once she
had met a foe worthy of her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that will be best, and I dare say you will find
it very comfortable,” Mrs. Hallam said, admiring the
girl as she had never admired her before, and thinking
that before Rex came she would manage to make a
change.</p>

<p class='c012'>That night, however, she had Bertha’s dinner sent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>her room, and also made arrangements to have her
coffee served there in the morning, so it was not until
lunch that she had her first experience as second-class.
The hall, which was not used for the servants of the
house, who had their meals elsewhere, was a long room
on the ground-floor, and there she found assembled a
mixed company of nurses, maids, couriers, and valets,
all talking together in a babel of tongues, English,
French, German, Italian, Russian, and Greek, and all so
earnest that they did not see the graceful young woman
who, with a heightened color and eyes which shone like
stars as they took in the scene, walked to the only vacant
seat she saw, which was evidently intended for her,
as it was next the courier Browne. But when they did
see her they became as silent as if the king himself had
come into their midst, while Browne rose to his feet,
and with a respectful bow held her chair for her until
she was seated, and then asked what he should order for
her. Browne, who was a respectable middle-aged man
and had traveled extensively with both English and
Americans, had seen that Bertha was superior to her
employer, and had shown her many little attentions in
a respectful way. He had heard from Celine that she
was coming to the second salon, and resented it more,
if possible, than Bertha herself, resolving to constitute
himself her protector and shield her from every possible
annoyance. This she saw at once, and smiled gratefully
upon him. No one spoke to her, and silence
reigned as she finished her lunch and then left the room
with a bow in which all felt they were included.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By Jove, Browne, who is that person, and how came
she here? She looks like a lady,” asked an English
valet, while two or three Frenchmen nearly lost their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>balance with their fierce gesticulations, as they clamored
to know who the grande mademoiselle was.</p>

<p class='c012'>Striking his fist upon the table to enforce silence,
Browne said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is a Miss Leighton, from America, and far
more a lady than many of the bediamonded and besatined
trash above us. She is in my party as madam’s
companion, and whoever is guilty of the least impertinence
towards her in word or look will answer for it to
me; to <em>me</em>, do you understand?” And he turned
fiercely towards a wicked-looking little Frenchman,
whose bad eyes had rested too boldly and too admiringly
upon the girl.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i><span lang="fr">Mon Dieu, oui, oui, oui!</span></i>” the man replied, and then in
broken English asked, “Why comes she here, if she be
a lady?”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Celine who answered for Browne:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because her mistress is a cat, a nasty old cat,—as
the English say. And there is a pair of them. I heard
them last night saying she must be put down, and they
have put her down here. I hate them, and mine most
of all. She tries to get me cheap. She keeps me fly-fly.
She gives me no <i><span lang="fr">pourboires</span></i>. She sleeps me in a
dog-kennel. Bah! I stay not, if good chance come.
<i><span lang="fr">L’Amèricaine</span></i> hundred times more lady.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This voluble speech, which was interpreted by one to
another until all had a tolerably correct idea of it, did
not diminish the interest in Bertha, to whom after this
every possible respect was paid, the men always rising
with Browne when she entered the dining-hall and
remaining standing until she was seated. Bertha was
human, and such homage could not help pleasing her,
although it came from those whose language she could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>not understand, and who by birth and education were
greatly her inferiors. It was something to be the object
of so much respect, and when, warmed by the bright
smile she always gave them, the Greeks, and the
Russians, and the Italians, not only rose when she
entered the hall, but also when she passed them outside,
if they chanced to be sitting, she felt that her life had
some compensations, if it were one of drudgery and
menial service.</p>

<p class='c012'>True to her threat, Celine left when a more desirable
situation offered, and Mrs. Hallam did not fill her place.
“No need of it, so long as you have Miss Leighton and
pay her what you do,” Mrs. Haynes said; and so it
came about that Bertha found herself companion in
name only and waiting-maid in earnest, walking demurely
by the covered chair which each morning took
Mrs. Hallam to her bath, combing that lady’s hair,
mending and brushing her clothes, carrying messages,
doing far more than Celine had done, and doing it so
uncomplainingly that both Mrs. Hallam and Mrs.
Haynes wondered at her. At last, however, when asked
to accompany Mrs. Haynes to the bath, she rebelled.
To serve her in that way was impossible, and she answered
civilly, but decidedly, “No, Mrs. Hallam. I
have done and will do whatever you require for yourself,
but for Mrs. Haynes, nothing. She never spares an
opportunity to humiliate me. I will not attend her to
her bath. I will give up my place first.” That settled
it, and Bertha was never again asked to wait upon Mrs.
Haynes.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='large'>GRACE HAYNES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Bravo, Miss Leighton! I did not suppose there was
so much spirit in you, when I saw you darning madam’s
stockings and buttoning her boots. You are a brick
and positively I admire you. Neither mamma nor Mrs
Hallam needs any one to go with them, any more than
the sea needs water. But it is English, you know, to
have an attendant, and such an attendant, too, as you.
Yes, I admire you! I respect you! Our door was open,
and I heard what you said; so did mamma, and she is
furious; but I am glad to see one woman assert her
rights.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Grace Haynes, who, coming from her bedroom,
joined Bertha, as she was walking rapidly down the hall
and said all this to her. Bertha had been nearly two
weeks at Aix, and, although she had scarcely exchanged
a word with Grace, she had often seen her, and remembering
what Mrs. Hallam had said of her and Reginald,
had looked at her rather critically. She was very thin
and wiry, with a pale face, yellow hair worn short, large
blue eyes, and a nose inclined to an upward curve.
She was a kind-hearted, good-natured girl, of a pronounced
type both in dress and manner and speech.
She believed in a little slang, she said, because it gave a
point to conversation, and she adored baccarat and
rouge-et-noir, and a lot more things which her mother
thought highly improper. She had heard all that her
mother said of Bertha, and, quick to discriminate, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>had seen how infinitely superior she was to Mrs. Hallam
and had felt drawn to her, but was too much absorbed
in her own matters to have any time for a stranger.
She was a natural flirt, and, although so plain, always
managed to have, as she said, two or three idiots
dangling on her string. Just now it was a young Englishman,
the grandson of old Lady Gresham, whom she
had upon her string, greatly to the disgust of her mother,
with whom she was not often in perfect accord.</p>

<p class='c012'>Linking her arm in Bertha’s as they went down the
stairs, she continued, “Are you going to walk? I am,
up the hill. Come with me. I’ve been dying to talk to
you ever since you came, but have been so engaged, and
you are always so busy with madam since Celine went
away. Good pious work you must find it waiting on
madam and mamma both! I don’t see how you do it so
sweetly. You must have a great deal of what they
call inward and spiritual grace. I wish you’d give me
some.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Grace was the first girl of her own age and nation who
had spoken to Bertha since she left America, and she
responded readily to the friendly advance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t believe I have any inward and spiritual
grace to spare,” she said. “I only do what I hired out
to do. You know I must earn my wages.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Grace answered, “I know, and I wish I could
earn wages, too. It would be infinitely more respectable
than the way we get our money.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you get it?” Bertha asked, and Grace replied,
“Don’t you know? You have certainly heard of
high-born English dames who, for a consideration, undertake
to hoist ambitious Americans into society?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha had heard of such things, and Grace continued,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Well, that is what mamma does at home on a
smaller scale; and she succeeds, too. Everybody
knows Mrs. Walker Haynes, with blood so blue that
indigo is pale beside it, and if she pulls a string for a
puppet to dance, all the other puppets dance in unison.
Sometimes she chaperons a party of young ladies, but as
these give her a good deal of trouble, she prefers people
like Mrs. Hallam, who without her would never get
into society. Society! I hate the word, with all it involves.
Do you see that colt over there?” and she
pointed to a young horse in an adjoining field. “Well,
I am like that colt, kicking up its heels in a perfect
abandon of freedom. But harness it to a cart, with
thills and lines and straps and reins, and then apply the
whip, won’t it rebel with all its might? And if it gets
its feet over the traces and breaks in the dash-board
who can blame it? I’m just like that colt. I hate that
old go-giggle called society, which says you mustn’t do
this and you must do that because it is or is not proper
and Mrs. Grundy would be shocked. I like to shock
her, and I’d rather take boarders than live as we do
now. I’d do anything to earn money. That’s why I
play at baccarat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Baccarat!” Bertha repeated, with a little start.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, baccarat. Don’t try to pull away from me. I
felt you,” Grace said, holding Bertha closer by the arm.
“You are Massachusetts born and have a lot of Massachusetts
notions, of course, and I respect you for it,
but I am Bohemian through and through. Wasn’t born
anywhere in particular, and have been in your so-called
first society all my life and detest it. We have a little
income, and could live in the country with one servant
comfortably, as so many people do; but that would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>suit mamma, and so we go from pillar to post and live
on other people, until I am ashamed. I am successful
at baccarat. They say the old gent who tempted Eve
helps new beginners at cards, and I believe he helps me,
I win so often. I know it isn’t good form, but what can
I do? If I don’t play baccarat there’s nothing left for
me but to marry, and that I never shall.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not?” Bertha asked, becoming more and more
interested in the strange girl talking so confidentially
to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not?” Grace repeated. “That shows that you
are not in it,—the swim, I mean. Don’t you know that
few young men nowadays can afford to marry a poor
girl and support her in her extravagance and laziness?
She must have money to get any kind of a show, and
that I haven’t,—nor beauty either, like you, whose face
is worth a fortune. Don’t say it isn’t; don’t fib,” she
continued, as Bertha tried to speak. “You know you
are beautiful, with a grande-duchesse air which makes
everybody turn to look at you, even the king. I saw
him, and I’ve seen those Russians and Greeks, who are
here with some high cockalorums, take off their hats
when you came near them. Celine told me how they all
stand up when you enter the <i><span lang="fr">salle-à-manger</span></i>. I call that
genuine homage, which I’d give a good deal to have.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She had let go Bertha’s arm and was walking a little
in advance, when she stopped suddenly, and, turning
round, said, “I wonder what you will think of Rex
Hallam.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha made no reply, and she went on: “I know
I am talking queerly, but I must let myself out to some
one. Rex is coming before long, and you will know
then, if you don’t now, that mamma is moving heaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>and earth to make a match between us; but she never
will. I am not his style, and he is far more likely to
marry you than me. I have known him for years, and
could get up a real liking for him if it would be of any
use, but it wouldn’t. He doesn’t want a washed-out,
yellow-haired girl like me. Nobody does, unless it’s
Jack Travis, old Lady Gresham’s grandson, with no
prospects and only a hundred pounds a year and an
orange grove in Florida, which he never saw, and which
yields nothing, for want of proper attention. He says
he would like to go out there and rough it; that he does
not like being tied to his grandmother’s apron-strings;
and that, give him a chance, he would gladly work. I
have two hundred dollars a year more. Do you think
we could live on that and the climate?”</p>

<p class='c012'>They had been retracing their steps, and were near
the hotel, where they met the young Englishman in
question, evidently looking for Miss Haynes. He was
a shambling, loose-jointed young man, but he had a
good face, and there was a ring in his voice which Bertha
liked, as he spoke first to Grace and then to herself,
as Grace presented him to her. Knowing that as a
third party she was in the way, Bertha left them and
went into the hotel, while they went down into the town,
where they stayed so long that Lady Gresham and Mrs.
Haynes began to get anxious as to their whereabouts.
Both ladies knew of the intimacy between the young
people, and both heartily disapproved of it. Under
some circumstances Mrs. Haynes would have been delighted
to have for a son-in-law Lady Gresham’s grandson.
But she prized money more than a title, and one
hundred pounds a year with a doubtful orange grove in
Florida did not commend themselves to her, while Lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Gresham, although very gracious to Mrs. Haynes,
because it was not in her nature to be otherwise to any
one, did not like the fast American girl, who wore her
hair short, carried her hands in her pockets like a man,
and believed in women’s rights. If Jack were insane
enough to marry her she would wash her hands of him
and send him off to that orange grove, where she had
heard there was a little dilapidated house in which he
could try to live on the climate and one hundred a year.
Some such thoughts as these were passing through
Lady Gresham’s mind, while Mrs. Haynes was thinking
of Grace’s perversity in encouraging young Travis, and
of Reginald Hallam, from whom Mrs. Hallam had that
morning had a letter and who was coming to Aix earlier
than he had intended doing. Nearly all his friends
were out of town, he wrote, and the house was so lonely
without his aunt that she might expect him within two
or three weeks at the farthest. He did not say what
steamer he should take, but, as ten days had elapsed
since his letter was written, Mrs. Hallam said she should
not be surprised to see him at any time, and her face
wore an air of pleased expectancy at the prospect of
having Rex with her once more. But a thought of Bertha
brought a cloud upon it at once. She had intended
removing her from the second-class <i><span lang="fr">salle-à-manger</span></i> before
Rex came, but did not know how to manage it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The girl seems contented enough,” she thought,
“and I hear has a great deal of attention there,—in
fact, is quite like a queen among her subjects; so I
guess I’ll let it run, and if Rex flares up I’ll trust Mrs.
Haynes to help me out of it, as she got me into it.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='large'>THE NIGHT OF THE OPERA.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was getting rather dull at the Hôtel Splendide.
The novelty of having a king in their midst, who went
about unattended in citizen’s dress, and bowed to all
who looked as if they wished him to bow to them, was
wearing off, and he could go in and out as often as he
liked without being followed or stared at. The grand
duchess, too, whose apartments were screened from
the great unwashed, had had her Sunday dinner-party,
with scions of French royalty in the Bourbon line for
her guests, and a band of music outside. The woman
from Chicago, who had flirted so outrageously with her
eyes with the Russian, while his little wife sat by smiling
placidly and suspecting no evil because the
Chicagoan professed to speak no language but English,
of which her husband did not understand a word, had
departed for other fields. The French count, who had
beaten his American bride of three weeks’ standing,
had also gone, and the hotel had subsided into a state
of great respectability and circumspection.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Positively we are stagnating, with nothing to gossip
about except Jack and myself, and nothing going on in
town,” Grace Haynes said to Bertha, with whom she
continued on the most friendly terms.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the stagnation came to an end and the town
woke up when it was known that Miss Sanderson from
San Francisco was to appear in opera at the Casino.
Everybody had heard of the young prima donna, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>all were anxious to see her. Mrs. Hallam took a box
for Mrs. Haynes, Grace, and herself, but, although
there was plenty of room, Bertha was not included in
the party. Nearly all the guests were going from the
third floor, which would thus be left entirely to the
servants, and Mrs. Hallam, who was always suspecting
foreigners of pilfering from her, did not dare leave
her rooms alone, so Bertha must stay and watch them.
She had done this before when Mrs. Hallam was at the
Casino, but to-night it seemed particularly hard, as she
wished to see Miss Sanderson so much that she would
willingly have stood in the rear seats near the door,
where a crowd always congregated. But there was no
help for it, and after seeing Mrs. Hallam and her party
off she went into the salon, and, taking an easy-chair
and a book, sat down to enjoy the quiet and the rest.
She was very tired, for Mrs. Hallam had kept her unusually
busy that day, arranging the dress she was going
to wear, and sending her twice down the long, steep
hill into the town in quest of something needed for her
toilet. It was very still in and around the hotel, and at
last, overcome by fatigue and drowsiness, Bertha’s book
dropped into her lap and she fell asleep with her head
thrown back against the cushioned chair and one hand
resting on its arm. Had she tried she could not have
chosen a more graceful position, or one which showed
her face and figure to better advantage, and so thought
Rex Hallam, when, fifteen or twenty minutes later, he
stepped into the room and stood looking at her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ever since his visit to the Homestead he had found
his thoughts constantly turning to Aix-les-Bains, and had
made up his mind to go on a certain ship, when he accidentally
met Fred Thurston, who was stopping in New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>York for two or three days before sailing. There was
an invitation to dinner at the Windsor, and as a result
Rex packed his trunk, and, securing a vacant berth,
sailed for Havre with the Thurstons a week earlier than
he had expected to sail. Fred was sick all the voyage
and kept his berth, but Louie seemed perfectly well, and
had never been so happy since she was a child playing
with Rex under the magnolias in Florida as she
was now, walking and talking with him upon the deck,
where, with her piquant, childish beauty, she attracted
a great deal of attention and provoked some comment
from the censorious when it was known that she had a
husband sick in his berth. But Louie was guiltless of
any intentional wrong-doing. She had said to Bertha
in Boston, that she believed Fred was going to die, he
was so good; and, with a few exceptions, when the
Hyde nature was in the ascendant, he had kept good
ever since. He had urged Rex’s going with them quite
as strongly as Louie, and when he found himself
unable to stay on deck, he had bidden Louie go and enjoy
herself, saying, however:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know what a flirt you are, but I can trust Rex
Hallam, on whom your doll beauty has never made an
impression and never will; so go and be happy with
him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was not a pleasant thing to say, but it was like
Fred Thurston to say it, and he looked curiously at
Louie to see how it would affect her. There was a flush
on her face for a moment, while the tears sprang to her
eyes. But she was of too sunny a disposition to be miserable
long, and, thinking to herself, “Just for this
one week I will be happy,” she tied on her pretty sea-cloak
and hood, and went on deck, and was happy as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>child when something it has lost and mourned is found
again. At Paris they separated, the Thurstons going on
to Switzerland, and Rex to Aix-les-Bains, laden with
messages of love to Bertha, who had been the principal
subject of Louie’s talk during the voyage. In a burst
of confidence Rex had told her of Rose Arabella Jefferson’s
photograph, and Louie had laughed merrily
over the mistake, saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will find Bertha handsomer than her picture.
I think you will fall in love with her; and—if—you—do——”
she spoke the last words very slowly, while
shadow after shadow flitted over her face as if she were
fighting some battle with herself; then, with a bright
smile, she added, “I shall be glad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex’s journey from Paris to Aix was accomplished
without any worse mishap than a detention of the train
for three hours or more, so that it was not until his aunt
had been gone some time that he reached the hotel,
where he was told that Mrs. Hallam and party were at
the Casino.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose she has a salon. I will go there and wait
till she returns,” Rex said, and then followed a servant
up-stairs and along the hall in the direction of the
salon.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had expected to find it locked, and was rather surprised
when he saw the open door and the light inside,
and still more surprised as he entered the room to find
a young lady so fast asleep that his coming did not disturb
her. He readily guessed who she was, and for a
moment stood looking at her admiringly, noting every
point of beauty from the long lashes shading her cheeks
to the white hand resting upon the arm of the chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Phineas was right. She is handsome as blazes, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>I don’t think it is quite the thing for me to stand staring
at her this way. It is taking an unfair advantage of
her. I must present myself properly,” he thought, and,
stepping into the hall, he knocked rather loudly upon
the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha awoke with a start and sprang to her feet in
some alarm as, in response to her “Entrez,” a tall young
man stepped into the room and stood confronting her
with a good deal of assurance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must have made a mistake, sir. This is Mrs.
Hallam’s salon,” she said, rather haughtily, while Rex
replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I know it. Mrs. Hallam is my aunt, and you
must be Miss Leighton.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” Bertha exclaimed, her attitude changing at
once, as she recognized the stranger. “Your aunt is
expecting you, but not quite so soon. She will be very
sorry not to have been here to meet you. She has gone
to the opera. Miss Sanderson is in town.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So they told me at the office,” Rex said, explaining
that he had crossed a little sooner than he had intended,
but did not telegraph his aunt, as he wished to surprise
her. He then added, “I am too late for dinner, but I
suppose I can have my supper up here, which will be
better than climbing the three flights of stairs again.
That scoop of an elevator has gone ashore for repairs,
and I had to walk up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ringing the bell, he ordered his supper, while Bertha
started to leave the salon, saying she hoped he would
make himself comfortable until his aunt returned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t go,” he said, stepping between her and the
door to detain her. “Stay and keep me company. I
have been shut up in a close railway carriage all day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>with French and Germans, and am dying to talk to
some one who speaks English.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He made her sit down in the chair from which she
had risen when he came in, and, drawing another near
to her, said, “You do not seem like a stranger, but
rather like an old acquaintance. Why, for a whole
week I have heard of little else but you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of me!” Bertha said, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>He replied, “I crossed with Mr. and Mrs. Fred
Thurston. She, I believe, is your cousin, and was never
tired of talking of you, and has sent more love to you
than one man ought to carry for some one else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cousin Louie! Yes, I knew she was coming about
this time. And you crossed with her?” Bertha said,
thinking what a fine-looking man he was, while there
came to her mind what Louie had said of his graciousness
of manner, which made every woman think she
was especially pleasing to him, whether she were old or
young, pretty or plain, rich or poor. He talked so
easily and pleasantly and familiarly that it was difficult
to think of him as a stranger, and she was not sorry
that he had bidden her stay.</p>

<p class='c012'>When supper was on the table he looked it over a
moment, and then said to the waiter, “Bring dishes
and napkins enough for two;” then to Bertha, “If I remember
the <i><span lang="fr">table d’hôtes</span></i> abroad, they are not of a
nature to make one refuse supper at ten o’clock; so I
hope you are ready to join me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha had been treated as second-class so long that
she had almost come to believe she <em>was</em> second-class, and
the idea of sitting down to supper with Rex Hallam in
his aunt’s salon took her breath away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t refuse,” he continued. “It will be so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>jollier than eating alone, and I want you to pour my
coffee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He brought her a chair, and before she realized what
she was doing she found herself sitting opposite him
quite <i><span lang="fr">en famille</span></i>, and chatting as familiarly as if she had
known him all her life. He told her of his visit to the
Homestead, his drive with Dorcas, and his meeting with
Phineas Jones, over which she laughed merrily, feeling
that America was not nearly so far away as it had
seemed before he came. When supper was over and
the table cleared, he began to talk of books and pictures,
finding that as a rule they liked the same authors
and admired the same artists.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the way,” he said, suddenly, “why are you not
at the opera with my aunt? Are you not fond of
music?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, very,” Bertha replied, “but some one must stay
with the rooms. Mrs. Hallam is afraid to leave them
alone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, yes. Afraid somebody will steal her diamonds,
which she keeps doubly and trebly locked, first in a
padded box, then in her trunk, and last in her room.
Well, I am glad for my sake that you didn’t go. But
isn’t it rather close up here? Suppose we go down.
It’s a glorious moonlight night, and there must be a
piazza somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha thought of the broad, vine-wreathed piazza,
with its easy-chairs, where it would be delightful to sit
with Reginald Hallam, but she must not leave her post,
and she said so.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I see; another case of the boy on the burning
deck,” Rex said, laughing. “I suppose you are right;
but I never had much patience with that boy. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>shouldn’t have stayed till I was blown higher than a
kite, but should have run with the first sniff of fire.
You think I’d better go down? Not a bit of it; if you
stay here, I shall. It can’t be long now before they
come. Zounds! I beg your pardon. Until I said <em>they</em>, I
had forgotten to inquire for Mrs. Haynes and Grace.
They are well, I suppose, and with my aunt?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha said they were, and Rex continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Grace and I are great friends. She’s a little peculiar,—wants
to vote, and all that sort of thing,—but I
like her immensely.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then he talked on indifferent subjects until Mrs. Hallam
was heard coming along the hall, panting and talking
loudly, and evidently out of humor. The elevator,
which Rex said had been drawn off for repairs, was
still off, and she had been obliged to walk up the stairs,
and didn’t like it. Bertha had risen to her feet as soon
as she heard her voice, while Rex, too, rose and stood
behind her in the shadow, so his aunt did not see him as
she entered the room, and, sinking into the nearest
chair, said, irritably:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurry and help me off with my things. I’m half
dead. Whew! Isn’t that lamp smoking? How it
smells here! Open another window. The lift is not
running, and I had to walk up the stairs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I knew it stopped earlier in the evening, but supposed
it was running now. I am very sorry,” Bertha
said, and Mrs. Hallam continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You ought to have found out and been down there
to help me up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t come any too soon,” Rex thought, stepping
out from the shadow, and saying, in his cheery voice,
“Halloo, auntie! All tuckered out, aren’t you, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>those horrible stairs! I tried them, and they took the
wind out of me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Rex, Rex!” Mrs. Hallam cried, throwing her
arms around the tall young man, who bent over her and
returned her caresses, while he explained that he did
not telegraph, as he wished to surprise her, and that he
had reached the hotel half an hour or so after she
left it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why didn’t you come at once to the Casino? There
was plenty of room in our box, and you must have been
so dull here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex replied: “Not at all dull, with Miss Leighton
for company. I ordered my supper up here and had
her join me. So you see I have made myself quite at
home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see,” Mrs. Hallam said, with a tone in her voice
and a shutting together of her lips which Bertha understood
perfectly.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had gathered up Mrs. Hallam’s mantle and bonnet
and opera-glass and fan and gloves by this time;
and, knowing she was no longer needed, she left the
room just as Mrs. Haynes and Grace, who had heard
Rex’s voice, entered it.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII. <br> <span class='large'>AFTER THE OPERA.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The ladies slept late the next morning, and Rex
breakfasted alone and then went to the salon to meet
his aunt, as he had promised to do the night before. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>was rather tiresome waiting, and he found himself
wishing Bertha would come in, and wondering where
she was. As a young man of position and wealth and
unexceptionable habits, he was a general favorite with
the ladies, and many a mother would gladly have
captured him for her daughter, while the daughter
would not have said no if asked to be his wife. This
he knew perfectly well, but, he said, the daughters didn’t
fill the bill. He wanted a real girl, not a made-up one,
with powdered face, bleached hair, belladonna eyes,
and all the obnoxious habits so fast stealing into the
best society. Little Louie Thurston had touched his
boyish fancy, and he admired her more than any other
woman he had ever met; Grace Haynes amused and
interested him; but neither she nor Louie possessed
the qualities with which he had endowed his ideal wife,
who, he had come to believe, did not exist. Thus far
everything connected with Bertha Leighton had interested
him greatly, and the two hours he had spent
alone with her had deepened that interest. She was
beautiful, agreeable, and real, he believed, with something
fresh and bright and original about her. He was
anxious to see her again, and was thinking of going
down to the piazza, hoping to find her there, when his
aunt appeared, and for the next hour he sat with her,
telling her of their friends in New York and of his visit
to the Homestead, where he had been so hospitably
entertained and made so many discoveries with regard
to Bertha.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is a great favorite in Leicester,” he said, “and
I think you have a treasure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, she serves me very well,” Mrs. Hallam replied,
and then changed the conversation, just as Grace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>knocked at the door, saying she was going for a walk
into town, and asking if Rex would like to go with
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a long ramble they had together, while Grace
told him of her acquaintances in Aix, and especially of
the young Englishman, Jack Travis, and the Florida
orange grove on which he had sunk a thousand dollars
with no return.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell him to quit sinking, and go and see to it himself,”
Rex said. “Living in England or at the North
and sending money South to be used on a grove, is
much like a woman trying to keep house successfully
by sitting in her chamber and issuing her orders through
a speaking tube, instead of going to the kitchen herself
to see what is being done there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex’s illustrations were rather peculiar, but they
were sensible. Grace understood this one perfectly,
and began to revolve in her mind the feasibility of advising
Jack to go to Florida and attend to his business
himself, instead of talking through a tube. Then she
spoke of Bertha, and was at once conscious of an air of
increased interest in Reginald, as she told him how
much she liked the girl and how strangely he seemed to
be mixed up with her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see, Mrs. Hallam tells mamma everything,
and so I know all about Rose Arabella Jefferson’s picture.
I nearly fell out of my chair when I heard about
it; and I know, too, about your knocking Miss Leighton
down on the Teutonic——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wha-at!” Rex exclaimed; “was that Ber—Miss
Leighton, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly that was Bertha. You may as well call
her that when with me,” Grace replied. “I knew you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>would admire her. You can’t help it. I am glad you
have come, and I hope you will rectify a lot of things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex looked at her inquiringly, but before he could
ask what she meant, they turned a corner and came
upon Jack Travis, who joined them, and on hearing
that Rex was from New York began to ask after his
orange grove, as if he thought Reginald passed it
daily on his way to his business.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a stupid you are!” Grace said. “Mr. Hallam
never saw an orange grove in his life. Why, you could
put three or four United Kingdoms into the space
between New York and Florida.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Reely! How very extraordinary!” the young
Englishman said, utterly unable to comprehend the
vastness of America, towards which he was beginning
to turn his thoughts as a place where he might possibly
live on seven hundred dollars a year with Grace to
manage it and him.</p>

<p class='c012'>When they reached the hotel it was lunch-time, and
after a few touches to his toilet Rex started for the
<i><span lang="fr">salle-à-manger</span></i>, thinking that now he should see
Bertha, in whom he felt a still greater interest since
learning that it was she to whom he had given the
black eye on the Teutonic. “The hand of fate is certainly
in it,” he thought, without exactly knowing what
the <em>it</em> referred to. Mrs. Hallam and Mrs. Haynes and
Grace were already at the table when he entered the
room and was shown to the only vacant seat, between
his aunt and Grace.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This must be Miss Leighton’s place,” he said, standing
by the chair. “I do not wish to keep her from her
accustomed seat. Where is she?” and he looked up and
down both sides of the long table, but did not see her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Where is she?” he asked again, and his aunt replied
“She is not coming to-day. Sit down, and I will
explain after lunch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is there to explain?” he thought, as he sat
down and glanced first at his aunt’s worried face, then
at Grace, and then at Mrs. Haynes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then an idea occurred to him which almost made him
jump from his chair. He said to Grace:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does Miss Leighton lunch in her room?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” Grace replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Doesn’t she come here?” he persisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your aunt will explain. I would rather not,” Grace
said.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was something wrong, Rex was sure, and he
finished lunch before the others and left the salon just
in time to see Bertha half-way up the second flight of
stairs. Bounding up two steps at a time, he soon stood
beside her, with his hand on her arm to help her up the
next flight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have not seen you this morning. Where have
you kept yourself?” he asked, and she replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have been busy in your aunt’s room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is her maid?” was his next question, and
Bertha answered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“She has been gone some time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And <em>you</em> fill her place?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do what Mrs. Hallam wishes me to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why were you not at lunch?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have been to lunch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<em>You have!</em> Where?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where I always take it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And <em>where</em> is that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was something in Rex’s voice and manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>which told Bertha that he was not to be trifled with,
and she replied, “I take my meals in the servants’ hall,
or rather with the maids and nurses and couriers. It is
not bad when you are accustomed to it,” she added, as
she saw the blackness on Reginald’s face and the wrath
in his eyes. They had now reached the door of Mrs.
Hallam’s room, and Mrs. Hallam was just leaving the
elevator in company with Mrs. Haynes, who very wisely
went into her own apartment and left her friend to
meet the storm alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>And a fierce storm it was. At its close Mrs. Hallam
was in tears, and Rex was striding up and down the
salon like an enraged lion. Mrs. Hallam had tried to
apologize and explain, telling how respectful all the
couriers and valets were, how much less it cost, and that
Mrs. Haynes said the English sent their companions
there, and governesses too, sometimes. Rex did not
care a picayune for what the English did; he almost
swore about Mrs. Haynes, whose handiwork he recognized;
he scorned the idea of its costing less, and said
that unless Bertha were at once treated as an equal in
every respect he would either leave the hotel or join
her in the second-class salon and see for himself whether
those rascally Russians and Turks and Frenchmen
looked at her as they had no business to look.</p>

<p class='c012'>At this point Bertha, who had no suspicion of what was
taking place in the salon, and who wished to speak to
Mrs. Hallam, knocked at the door. Rex opened it with
the intention of sending the intruder away, but when he
saw Bertha he bade her come in, and, standing with his
back against the door, went over the whole matter
again and told her she was to join them at dinner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And if there is no place for you at my aunt’s end of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the table there is at the other, and I shall sit there with
you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had settled everything satisfactorily, he thought,
when a fresh difficulty arose with Bertha herself. She
had listened in surprise to Rex, and smiled gratefully
upon him through the tears she could not repress, but
she said, “I cannot tell you how much I thank you for
your sympathy and kind intentions. But really I am
not unhappy in the servants’ hall, nor have I received
the slightest discourtesy. Browne, our courier, has
stood between me and everything which might have
been unpleasant, and I have quite a liking for my companions.
And,”—here her face hardened and her eyes
grew very dark,—“nothing can induce me to join your
party as you propose while Mrs. Haynes is in it. She
has worried and insulted me from the moment she saw
me. She suggested and urged my going to the servants’
hall against your aunt’s wishes, and has never let
an opportunity pass to make me feel my subordinate
position. I like Miss Haynes very much, but her mother ——” there
was a toss of Bertha’s head indicative of
her opinion of the mother, an opinion which Rex fully
shared, and if he could he would have turned Mrs.
Haynes from the hotel bag and baggage.</p>

<p class='c012'>But this was impossible. He could neither dislodge
her nor move Bertha from her decision, which he understood
and respected. But he could take her and his
aunt away from Aix and commence life under different
auspices in some other place. He had promised to join
a party of friends at Chamonix, and he would go there
at once, and then find some quiet, restful place in Switzerland,
from which excursions could be made and where
his aunt could join him with Bertha. This was his plan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>which met with Mrs. Hallam’s approval. She was getting
tired of Aix, and a little tired, too, of Mrs. Haynes,
who had not helped her into society as much as she
had expected. Lady Gresham, though civil, evidently
shunned the party, presumably because of Grace’s flirtation
with Jack, while very few desirable people were on
terms of intimacy with her, and the undesirable she
would not notice. In fresh fields, however, with Rex,
who took precedence everywhere, she should do better,
and she was quite willing to go wherever and whenever
he chose. That night at dinner she told Mrs. Haynes
her plans, and that Rex was to leave the next day for
Chamonix.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So soon? I am surprised, and sorry, too; Grace
has anticipated your coming so much and planned so
many things to do when you came. She will be so disappointed.
Can’t we persuade you to stop a few days
at least?” Mrs. Haynes said, leaning forward and looking
at Rex with a very appealing face, while Grace
stepped on her foot and whispered to her:</p>

<p class='c012'>“For heaven’s sake, don’t throw me at Rex Hallam’s
head, and make him more disgusted with us than he is
already.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The next morning Rex brought his aunt a little,
black-eyed French girl, Eloïse, whom he had found in
town, and who had once or twice served in the capacity
of maid. He had made the bargain with her himself,
and such a bargain as he felt sure would ensure her stay
in his aunt’s service, no matter what was put upon her.
He had also enumerated many of the duties the girl
was expected to perform, and among them was waiting
upon Miss Leighton equally with his aunt. He laid
great stress upon this, and, in order to secure Eloïse’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>respect for Bertha, he insisted if the latter would not go
to the same table with Mrs. Haynes she should take her
meals in the salon. To this Bertha reluctantly consented,
and at dinner she found herself installed in solitary
state in the handsome salon and served like a
young empress by the obsequious waiter, who, having
seen the color of Reginald’s gold, was all attention to
Mademoiselle. It was a great change, and in her loneliness
she half wished herself back with her heterogeneous
companions, who had amused and interested her, and
to some of whom she was really attached. But just as
dessert was served Rex came in and joined her, and
everything was changed, for there was no mistaking the
interest he was beginning to feel in her; it showed itself
in ways which never fail to reach a woman’s heart.
At his aunt’s earnest entreaty he had decided to spend
another night at Aix, but he left the next morning with
instructions that Mrs. Hallam should be ready to join
him whenever he wrote her to do so.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And mind,” he said, laying a hand on each of her
shoulders, “don’t you bring Mrs. Haynes with you, for
I will not have her. Pension her off, if you want to,
and I will pay the bill; but leave her here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was the telegram which Bertha received about
a week after Rex’s departure for Chamonix, and within
an hour of its receipt her trunk was packed and she
was ready for the first train which would take her to
Ouchy. Mrs. Hallam had made no objection to her going,
but, on the contrary, seemed rather relieved than
otherwise, for since the revolution which Rex had
brought about she hardly knew what to do with Bertha.
The maid Eloïse had proved a treasure, and under the
combined effects of Rex’s <i><span lang="fr">pourboire</span></i> and Rex’s instructions,
had devoted herself so assiduously to both Mrs.
Hallam and Bertha that it was difficult to tell which
she was serving most. But she ignored Mrs. Haynes
entirely, saying that Monsieur’s orders were for <em>his</em>
Madame and <em>his</em> Mademoiselle, and she should recognize
the rights of no third party until he told her to do
so. In compliance with Rex’s wishes, very decidedly
expressed, Mrs. Hallam now took all her meals in the
salon with Bertha, but they were rather dreary affairs,
and, although sorry for the cause, both were glad when
an opportunity came for a change.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“Certainly it is your duty to go,” Mrs. Hallam said,
when Bertha handed her the telegram, while Mrs.
Haynes also warmly approved of the plan, and both
expressed surprise that Bertha had never told them of
her relationship to Mrs. Fred Thurston.</p>

<p class='c012'>They knew Mrs. Fred was a power in society, and
Mrs. Haynes had met her once or twice and through a
friend had managed to attend a reception at her house,
which she described as magnificent. To be Mrs. Fred
Thurston’s cousin was to be somebody, and both Mrs.
Hallam and Mrs. Haynes became suddenly interested
in Bertha, the latter offering her advice with regard to
the journey, while the former suggested the propriety
of sending Browne as an escort. But Bertha declined
the offer. She could speak the language fluently and
would have no difficulty whatever in finding her way to
Ouchy, she said, but she thanked the ladies for their
solicitude and parted with them, apparently, on the
most amicable terms. Grace accompanied her to the
station, and while waiting for the train said to her confidentially,
“I expect there will be a bigger earthquake
bye-and-bye than Rex got up on your account. Jack and
I are engaged. I made up my mind last night to take
the great, good-natured, awkward fellow and run my
chance on seven hundred dollars a year. It will come
off early in the autumn, and we shall go to Florida and
see what we can do with that orange grove. Jack will
have to work, and so shall I, and I shall like it and he
won’t, but I shall keep him at it, trust me. Can you
imagine mother’s disgust when I tell her? She really
thinks that I have a chance with Rex. But that is
folly. Play your cards well. I think you hold a lore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>hand. There’s your train. Write when you get there,
Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a friendly parting, a rush through the
gate for the carriages, a slamming of doors, and then
the train sped on its way, bearing Bertha to a new
phase of life in Ouchy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thurston had been sick all the voyage, and instead of
resting in Paris, as Rex had advised him and Louie had
entreated him to do, he had started at once for Geneva
and taken a severe cold on the night train. Arrived at
the Beau-Rivage in Ouchy, he refused to see a physician
until his wife came down with nervous prostration and
one was called for her. Louie had had rather a hard
time after Rex left her in Paris, for, as if to make amends
for his Jekyll mood on the ship, her husband was unusually
unreasonable, and worried her so with sarcasm
and taunts and ridicule that her heart was very sore
when she reached Ouchy. The excitement of the voyage,
with Reginald as her constant companion, was
over, and she must again take up the old life, which
seemed drearier than ever because everything and
everybody were so strange, and she found herself constantly
longing for somebody to speak a kind and sympathetic
word to her. In this condition of things it was
not strange that she succumbed at last to the extreme
nervous depression which had affected her in Boston,
and which was now so intensified that she could scarcely
lift her head from the pillow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am only tired,” she said to the physician, a kind,
fatherly old man, who asked her what was the matter.
“Only tired of life, which is not worth the living.”
And her sad blue eyes looked up so pathetically into his
face that the doctor felt moved with a great pity for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>young, beautiful woman, surrounded with every luxury
money could buy, but whose face and words told a
story he could not understand until called to prescribe
for her husband; and then he knew.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thurston had made a fight against the illness which
was stealing over him and which he swore he would
defy. Drugs and doctors were for silly women like
Louie, who must be amused, he said, but he would have
none of them. “Only exert your will and you can
cheat Death himself,” was his favorite saying, and he
exerted his will, and went to Chillon, rowed on the lake
in the moonlight, took a Turkish bath, and next day
had a chill, which lasted so long and left him so weak
that he consented to see the doctor, but raved like a
madman when told that he must go to bed and stay
there if he wished to save his life.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know that I care particularly about it. I
haven’t found it so very jolly,” he said; then, after a
moment, he added, with a bitter laugh, “Tell my wife
I am likely to shuffle off this mortal coil, and see how it
affects her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was either crazy, or a brute, or both, the doctor
thought, but he made him go to bed, secured the best
nurse he could find, and was there early the next morning
to see how his patient fared. He found him so
much worse that when he went to Louie he asked if she
had any friends near who could come to her, saying,
“If you have, send for them at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Louie was in a state where nothing startled her, and
without opening her eyes she said, “Am I going to
die?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” was the doctor’s reply, and she continued, “Is
my husband?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“I hope not, but he is very ill and growing steadily
worse. Have you any friend who will come to you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,—my cousin, Miss Leighton, at Aix,” Louie
answered; and she dictated the telegram, which the
doctor wrote after asking if she had no male friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a moment she hesitated, thinking of Reginald,
who would surely come if bidden, and be so strong and
helpful. But that would not do; and she answered,
“There is no one. Bertha can do everything.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Bertha was summoned, and the day after the
receipt of the telegram she was at the Beau-Rivage,
feeling that she had not come too soon when she saw
how utterly prostrated Louie was, and how excited and
unmanageable Thurston was becoming under the combined
effects of fever and his dislike of his nurse, who
could not speak a word of English, while he could understand
very little French. Frequent altercations
were the result, and when Bertha entered the sick-room
there was a fierce battle of words going on between the
two, Victoire trying to make the patient take his medicine,
while Fred sat bolt upright in bed, the perspiration
rolling down his face as he fought against the glass
and hurled at the half-crazed Frenchman every opprobrious
epithet in the English language. As Bertha
appeared the battle ceased, but not until the glass with
its contents was on the floor, where Thurston had
struck it from Victoire’s hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, Bertha,” he gasped, as he sank exhausted upon
his pillow, “did you drop from heaven, or where? and
won’t you tell this idiot that it is not time to take my
medicine? I know, for I have it written down in good
English. Blast that French language, which nobody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>can understand! I doubt if they do themselves, the
gabbling fools, with their <em>parleys</em> and <em>we-we’s</em>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It did not take Bertha long to bring order out of confusion.
She was a natural nurse, and when the doctor
came and she proposed to take Victoire’s place until a
more suitable man was found, her offer was accepted.
But it was no easy task she had assumed, and after two
days and nights, during which she was only relieved for
a few hours by John, Thurston’s valet, when sleep was
absolutely necessary, she was thoroughly worn out.
Leaving the sick man in charge of John, she started for
a ramble through the grounds, hoping that the air and
exercise would rest and strengthen her. The Thurston
rooms were at the rear of a long hall on the second
floor, and, as the other end was somewhat in shadow,
she only knew that some one was advancing towards
her as she went rapidly down the corridor. Nor did
she look up until a voice which sent a thrill through
every nerve said to her, “Good-afternoon, Miss Leighton.
Don’t you know me?” Then she stopped suddenly,
while a cry of delight escaped her, as she gave
both her hands into the warm, strong ones of Rex
Hallam, who held them fast while he questioned her
rapidly and told her how he chanced to be there. He
had joined his party at Chamonix, where they had
stayed for several days, crossing the Mer-de-Glace and
making other excursions among the mountains and
glaciers. He had then made a flying trip to Interlaken,
Lucerne, and Geneva, in quest of the place to which he
meant to remove his aunt, and had finally thought of
Ouchy, where he knew the Thurstons were, and to
which he had come in a boat from Geneva. Learning
at the office of his friend’s illness, he had started at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>for his room, meeting on the way with Bertha, whose
presence there he did not suspect. While he talked he
led her near to a window, where the light fell full upon
her face, showing him how pale and tired it was.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This will not do,” he said, when he had heard her
story. “I am glad I have come to relieve you. I shall
write to Aix to-day that I am going to stay here, where
I can be of service to Fred and Louie, and to you too.
You will not go back, of course, while your cousin needs
you. And now go out into the sunshine, and bye-and-bye
I’ll find you somewhere in the grounds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He had taken matters into his own hands in his masterful
way, and Bertha felt how delightful it was to have
some one to lean upon, and that one Rex Hallam, whose
voice was so full of sympathy, whose eyes looked at her
so kindly, and whose hands held hers so long and
seemed so unwilling to release them. With a blush she
withdrew them from his clasp. Leaving her at last, he
walked down the hall, entering Louie’s room first and
finding her asleep, with her maid in charge. For a
moment he stood looking at her white, wan face, which
touched him more than her fair beauty had ever done,
for on it he could read the story of her life, and a great
pity welled up in his heart for the girl who seemed so
like a lovely flower broken on its stem.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor little Louie!” he said, involuntarily, and at
the sound of his voice Louie awoke, recognizing him at
once, and exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Rex! I was dreaming of you and the magnolias.
I am so glad you are here! You will stay, won’t you?
I am afraid Fred is going to die, he is so bad, and then
what shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She gave him her hand, which he did not hold as long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>as he had held Bertha’s, nor did the holding it affect
him the same. Bertha’s had been warm and full of life,
with something electrical in their touch, which sent the
blood bounding through his veins and made him long
to kiss them, as well as the bright face raised so eagerly
to his. Louie’s hand was thin and clammy, and so
small that he could have crushed it easily, as he raised
it to his lips with the freedom of an old-time friend,
and just as he would have done had Fred himself been
present. He told her he should stay as long as he was
needed, and after a few moments went to see her husband,
who was beginning to grow restless and to fret
at Bertha’s absence. But at sight of Reginald his mood
changed, and he exclaimed joyfully:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rex, old boy, I wonder if you know how glad I am
to see you. I do believe I shall get well now you are
here, though I am having a big tussle with some confounded
thing,—typhoid, the doctor calls it; but doctors
are fools. How did you happen to drop down
here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex told him how he chanced to be there, and that
he was going to stay, and then, excusing himself, went
in quest of Bertha, whom he found sitting upon a rustic
seat which was partially concealed by a clump of
shrubbery. It was a glorious afternoon, and Rex, who
was very fond of boating, proposed a row upon the lake,
to which Bertha consented.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have had too many races with Harvard not to
know how to manage the oars myself,” he said, as he
handed Bertha into the boat, and dismissing the boy,
pushed off from the shore.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a delightful hour they spent together gliding
over the smooth waters of the lake, and in that time they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>became better acquainted than many people do in years.
There was no coquetry nor sham in Bertha’s nature,
while Rex was so open and frank, and they had so much
in common to talk about, that restraint was impossible
between them. Poor Rose Arabella Jefferson was discussed
and laughed over, Rex declaring his intention to
find her some time, if he made a pilgrimage to Scotsburg
on purpose. Then he spoke of the encounter on
the ship, and said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t tell you how many times I have thought of
that girl before I knew it was you, or how I have
wanted to see her and apologize properly for my awkwardness.
Something seems to be drawing us together
strangely.” Then he spoke again of his visit to the
Homestead, while Bertha became wonderfully animated
as she talked of her home, and Rex, watching her, felt
that he had never seen so beautiful a face as hers, or
listened to a sweeter voice. “I wonder if I am really
falling in love,” he thought, as he helped her from the
boat, while she was conscious of some subtle change
wrought in her during that hour on Lake Geneva, and
felt that life would never be to her again exactly what
it had been.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='large'>THE UNWELCOME GUEST.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Thurston was very ill with typhoid fever, which held
high carnival with him physically, but left him mentally
untouched. One afternoon, the fifth after Rex’s arrival,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>the two were alone, and for some time Fred lay with
his eyes closed and an expression of intense thought
upon his face. Then, turning suddenly to Rex, he said,
“Sit close to me. I want to tell you something.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex drew his chair to the bedside, and Fred continued,
“That idiot of a doctor has the same as told me
I am going to die, and, though I don’t believe him, I
can’t help feeling a little anxious about it, and I want
you to help me get ready.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly,” Rex answered, with a gasp, entirely
misunderstanding Fred’s meaning, and wishing the
task of getting his friend ready to die had devolved on
some one else. “We hope to pull you through, but it
is always well to be prepared for death, and I’ll help
you all I can. I’m afraid, though, you have called upon
a poor stick. I might say the Lord’s Prayer with you,
or, better yet,” and Rex grew quite cheerful, “there’s
a young American clergyman in the hotel. I will bring
him to see you. He’ll know just what to say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thunder!” Fred exclaimed, so energetically that
Rex started from his chair. “Don’t be a fool. I shall
die as I have lived, and if there is a hereafter, which I
doubt, I shall take my chance with the rest. I don’t
want your clergy round me, though I wouldn’t object
to hearing you say, ‘Our Father.’ It would be rather
jolly. I used to know it with a lot of other things, but
I quit it long ago,—left all the praying to Louie, who
goes on her knees regularly night and morning in
spite of my ridicule. Once, when she was posing beautifully,
with her long, white dressing-gown spread out
a yard or so on the floor, I walked over it on purpose
to irritate her, but didn’t succeed. I never did succeed
very well with Louie. But it is more my fault than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>hers, although I was fonder of her than she ever knew.
She never pretended to love me. She told me she
didn’t when she promised to marry me, and when I
asked her if any one stood between us she said no, but
added that there was somebody for whom she could
have cared a great deal if he had cared for her. I did
not ask her who it was, but I think I know, and she
would have been much happier with him than with me.
Poor Louie! maybe she will have a chance yet; and if
she does I am willing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His bright, feverish eyes were fixed curiously on Rex,
as he went on, “It’s for Louie and her matters I want
help, not for my soul; that’s all right, if I have one.
Louie is a child in experience, and you must see to her
when I am gone, and stand by her till she goes home.
There’ll be an awful row with the landlord, and no end
of expense, and a terrible muss to get me to America.
My man, John, will take what there is left of me to
Mount Auburn, if you start him right. Louie can’t go,
and you must stay with her and Bertha. If Mrs.
Grundy kicks up a row about your chaperoning a handsome
girl and a pretty young widow,—and, by Jove,
Louie will be that,—bring your aunt to the rescue;
that will make it square. And now about my will. I
made one last summer, and left everything to Louie on
condition that she did not marry again. That was nonsense.
She will marry if the right man offers;—wild
horses can’t hold her; and I want you to draw up
another will, with no conditions, giving a few thousands
to the Fresh Air Fund and the Humane Society. That
will please Louie. She’s great on children and horses.
What is it about a mortgage on old man Leighton’s
farm? Louie wanted me to pay it and keep Bertha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>from going out to service, as she called it. But I was in
one of my moods, and swore I wouldn’t. I am sorry
now I didn’t. Maybe I have a soul, after all, and that
is what is nagging me so when I think of the past. I
wish I knew how much the mortgage was.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know; I can tell you,” Rex said, with a great deal
of animation, as he proceeded to narrate the particulars
of the mortgage and his visit to the Homestead, while
Fred listened intently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ho-ho,” he said, with a laugh, when Rex had finished.
“Is that the way the wind blows? I thought
maybe—but never mind. Five hundred, is it? I’ll
make it a thousand, payable to Bertha at once. You’ll
find writing-materials in the desk by the window. And
hurry up; I’m getting infernally tired.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It did not take long to make the will, and when it
was finished, Rex and Mr. Thurston’s valet John and
Louie’s maid Martha, all Americans, witnessed it.
After that Fred, who was greatly exhausted, fell into a
heavy sleep, and when he awoke Bertha was alone with
him. He seemed very feverish, and asked for water,
which she gave him, and then bathed his forehead and
hands, while he said to her faintly, “You are a trump.
I wish I’d made it two thousand instead of one; but
Louie will make it right. Poor Louie! she’s going to
be so disappointed. It’s a big joke on her. I wonder
how she will take it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha had no idea what he meant, and made no reply,
while he continued, “Say, how does a fellow feel
when he has a soul?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bertha felt sure now that he was delirious, but before
she could answer he went on, “I never thought I had
one, but maybe I have. I feel so sorry for a lot of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>things, and mostly about Louie. Tell her so when I am
dead. Tell her I wasn’t half as bad a sort as she
thought. It will be like her to swathe herself in crape,
with a veil which sweeps the ground. Tell her not to.
Black will not become her. Think of Louie in a
widow’s cap!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Weak as he was, he laughed aloud at the thought of
it, and then began to talk of the prayer which had “forgive”
in it, and which Rex was to say with him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know it?” he asked, and, with her heart
swelling in her throat, Bertha answered that she did,
and asked if she should say it.</p>

<p class='c012'>He nodded, and Rex, who at that moment came unobserved
to the door, never forgot the picture of the
kneeling girl and the wistful, pathetic expression on the
face of the dying man as he tried to say the words
which had once been familiar to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Amen! So be it! Finis! I guess that makes it
about square. Tell Louie I prayed,” he whispered,
faintly, and never spoke again until the early morning
sunlight was shining on the lake and the hills of Savoy,
when he started suddenly and called, “Louie, Louie!
Where are you? I can’t find you. Oh, Louie, come to
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Louie was asleep in her room across the long
salon, and when, an hour later, she awoke, Bertha told
her that her husband was dead.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='large'>TANGLED THREADS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As Thurston had predicted, there was a great deal of
trouble and no end of expense; but Rex attended to
everything, while Bertha devoted herself to Louie, who
had gone from one hysterical paroxysm into another
until she was weaker and more helpless than she had
ever been, but not too weak to talk continually of Fred,
who, one would suppose, had been the tenderest of husbands.
All she had suffered at his hands was forgotten,
wiped out by the message he had left for her and by
knowing that his last thoughts had been of her. But
she spurned the idea of not wearing black, and insisted
that boxes of mourning dresses and bonnets and caps
should be sent to her on approbation from Geneva and
Lausanne, until her room looked like a bazaar of crape,
and not only Bertha and Martha, the maid, but Rex
was more than once called in for an opinion as to what
would be most suitable. It was rather a peculiar position
in which Rex found himself,—two young ladies on
his hands, with one of whom he was in love, while the
other would unquestionably be in love with him as soon
as her first burst of grief was over and she had settled
the details of her wardrobe. But he did not mind it;
in fact, he found it delightful to be associated daily with
Bertha, and to be constantly applied to for sympathy
and advice by Louie, who treated him with the freedom
and confidence of a sister, and he would not have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>thought of a change, if Bertha had not suggested it.
She had been told of the bequest which secured the
Homestead from sale and made it no longer necessary
for her to return to Mrs. Hallam, and she wrote at once
asking to be released from her engagement, but saying
she would keep it if her services were still desired.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a very gracious reply which Mrs. Hallam returned
to her, freeing her from all obligations to herself,
while something in the tone of the letter made
Bertha suspect that all was not as rose-colored at Aix as
it had been, and that Mrs. Hallam would be glad to
make one of the party at Ouchy. This she said to Rex,
suggesting that he should invite his aunt to join them,
and urging so strongly the propriety of either bringing
her to him, or going himself to her, that he finally
wrote to his aunt to come to him, and immediately received
a reply that she would be with him the next
day. Rex met her at the station in Lausanne, and
Bertha received her at the hotel as deferentially and
respectfully as if she were still her hired companion, a
condition which Mrs. Hallam had made up her mind to
ignore, especially as it no longer existed between them.
Taking both Bertha’s hands in hers, she kissed her
effusively and told her how much better she was looking
since she left Aix.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And no wonder,” she said. “The air there was not
good, and either that or something made me very
nervous, so that I did things for which I am sorry, and
which I hope you will forget.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was a great concession which Bertha received
graciously, and the two were on the best of terms when
they entered Louie’s room. Louie had improved
rapidly during the week, and was sitting in an easy-chair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>by the window, clad in a most becoming tea-gown
fashioned at Worth’s for the first stages of deep
mourning, and looking more like a girl of eighteen
than a widow of twenty-five. Notwithstanding her
husband’s assertion that black would not become her,
she had never been half so lovely as she was in her
weeds, and her face was never so fair as when framed
in her little crêpe bonnet and widow’s cap, which sat so
jauntily on her golden hair. “Dazzlingly beautiful and
altogether irresistible,” was Mrs. Hallam’s opinion as
the days went by, and Louie grew more and more
cheerful and sometimes forgot to put Fred’s photograph
under her pillow, and began to talk less of him and
more to Rex, whose attentions she claimed with an air
of ownership which would have amused Bertha if she
could have put from her the harrowing thought of
what might be a year hence, when the grave at Mount
Auburn was not as new, or Louie’s loss as fresh, as they
were now.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He cannot help loving her,” she would say to herself,
“and I ought to be glad to have her happy with
him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But she was not glad, and it showed in her face, whose
expression Rex could not understand. Louie’s was one
of those natures which, without meaning to be selfish,
make everything subservient to them. She was always
the centre about which others revolved, and Rex was
her willing slave, partly because of Thurston’s dying
charge, and partly because he could not resist her pretty
appealing ways, and would not if he could. But he
never dreamed of associating his devotion to her with
Bertha’s growing reserve. She was his real queen,
without whom his life at Ouchy would have been very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>irksome, and when she suggested going home, as Dorcas
had written urging her to do, he protested against it
almost as strenuously as Louie. She must stay, both
said, until she had seen something of Europe besides
Aix and Ouchy. So she stayed, and they spent September
at Interlaken and Lucerne, October in Paris,
and November at the Italian lakes, where she received
a letter from Grace, written in New York and signed
“Grace Haynes Travis.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We were married yesterday,” she wrote, “and
to-morrow we start for our Florida cabin and orange grove,
near Orlando, where so many English people
have settled. Mother gave in handsomely at the last,
when she found there was no help for it, and I actually
won over Lady Gresham, who used to think me a Hottentot,
and always spoke of me as ‘that dreadful American
girl.’ She invited mother and me to her country
house, The Limes, near London, and suggested that
Jack and I be married there. But I preferred New
York; so she gave us her blessing and a thousand
pounds, and mother, Jack, and I sailed three weeks ago
in the Umbria. When are you coming home? and how
is that pretty little Mrs. Thurston? I saw her once, and
thought her very lovely, with that sweet, clinging, helpless
manner which takes with men wonderfully. I have
heard that she was an old flame of Rex Hallam’s, or
rather a young one, but I’ll trust you to win him,
although as a widow she is dangerous; so, in the words
of the immortal Weller, I warn you, ‘Bevare of vidders.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was much more in the same strain, and Bertha
laughed over it, but felt a pang for which she hated herself
every time she looked at Louie, whose beauty and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>grace drew about her many admirers besides Rex, in
spite of her black dress and her frequent allusions to
“dear Fred, whose grave was so far away.” She was
growing stronger every day, and when in December Rex
received a letter from his partner saying that his presence
in New York was rather necessary, she declared
herself equal to the journey, and said that if Rex went
she should go too. Consequently the 1st of January
found them all in London, where they were to spend a
few days, and where Rex brought his aunt a letter,
addressed, bottom side up, to “Mrs. Lucy Ann Hallam,
Care of Brown, Shipley &#38; Co., London. <i><span lang="fr">Post Restant.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a gleam of humor in Rex’s eyes as he
handed the missive to his aunt, whose face grew dark
as she studied the outside, and darker still at the inside,
which was wonderful in composition and orthography.
Phineas Jones had been sent out to Scotland by an old
man who had some property there and who knew he
could trust Phineas to look after it and bring him back
the rental, which he had found it hard to collect. After
transacting his business, Phineas had decided to travel
a little and “get cultivated up, so that his cousin Lucy
Ann shouldn’t be ashamed of him.” Had he known
where she was, he would have joined her, but, as he did
not he wrote her a letter, which had in it a great deal
about Sturbridge and the old yellow house and the huckleberry
pasture and the circus and the spelling-school, all
of which filled Mrs. Hallam with disgust. She was his
only blood kin extant, he said, and he yearned to see
her, but supposed he must wait till she was back in New
York, when he should pay his respects to her at once.
And she wouldn’t be ashamed of him, either. He knew
what was what, and had hob-a-nobbed with nobility,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>who took a sight of notice of him. He was going to
sail the 10th in the Germanic, he said, and if she’d let
him know when she was coming home he’d be in New
York on the wharf to meet her.</p>

<p class='c012'>As it chanced, the Germanic was the boat in which
the Hallam party had taken passage for the 10th, but
Mrs. Hallam suddenly discovered that she had not seen
enough of London; Rex could go, if he must, but she
should wait for the next boat of the same line. Rex
had no suspicion as to the real reason for her change of
mind, and, as a week or two could make but little difference
in the business calling him home, he stayed,
and when the next boat of the White Star line sailed out
of the docks of Liverpool it carried the party of four:
Louie, limp and tearful as she thought of her husband
who had been with her when she crossed before; Mrs.
Hallam, excited and nervous, half expecting to see
Phineas pounce upon her, and haunted with a presentiment
that he was somewhere on the ship; and Rex,
with Bertha, hunting for the spot where he had first
seen her and knocked her down.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII. <br> <span class='large'>ON THE SEA.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was splendid weather for a few days, and no one
thought of being sea-sick, except Mrs. Hallam, who
kept her room, partly because she thought she must,
and partly because she could not shake off the feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>that Phineas was on board. She had read the few
names on the passenger-list, but his was not among
them, nor did she expect to find it, as he had sailed two
weeks before. Still, she would neither go on deck nor
into the dining-saloon, and without being really ill, kept
her berth and was waited upon by Eloïse, who was accompanying
her home. Louie, who was still delicate
and who always shrank from cold, stayed mostly in the
salon. But the briny, bracing sea air suited Bertha, and
for several hours each day she walked the deck with
Rex, whose arm was sometimes thrown around her
when the ship gave a great lurch, or when on turning a
corner they met the wind full in their faces. Then
there were the moonlight nights, when the air was full of
frost and the waves were like burnished silver, and in
her sealskin coat and cap, which Louie had bought for
her in Geneva, Bertha was never tired of walking and
never thought of the cold, for, if the exercise had not
kept her warm, the light which shone upon her from
Rex’s eyes when she met their gaze would have done
so. Perhaps he looked the same at Louie,—very likely
he did,—but for the present he was hers alone, and she
was supremely happy while the fine, warm weather
lasted and with it the companionship on deck. But
suddenly there came a change.</p>

<p class='c012'>Along the western coast of the Atlantic a wild storm
had been raging, and when it subsided there it swept
towards the east, gathering force as it went, and, joined
by the angry winds from every point of the compass, it
was almost a cyclone when it reached the Teutonic.
But the great ship met it bravely, mounting wave after
wave like a feather, then plunging down into the green
depths below, then rising again and shaking off the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>water as if the boiling sea were a mere plaything and the
storm gotten up for its pastime. The passengers, who
were told that there was no real danger, kept up their
courage while the day lasted, but when the night came
on and the darkness grew deeper in the salon, where
nearly all were assembled, many a face grew white
with fear as they listened to the howling of the wind
and the roaring of the sea, while wave after wave
struck the ship, which sometimes seemed to stand still,
and then, trembling in every joint, rose up to meet the
angry waves which beat upon it with such tremendous
force.</p>

<p class='c012'>Early in the day Louie had taken to her bed, where
she lay sobbing bitterly, while Bertha tried to comfort
her. As the darkness was increasing and the noise
overhead grew more and more deafening, Rex brought
his aunt to the salon, where, like many of the others,
she sat down upon the floor, clinging to one of the
chairs for support. Then he went to Louie and asked
if he should not take her there too.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no! oh, no!” she moaned. “I’d rather die
here, if you will stay with me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then a roll of the ship sent her out upon the
floor, where every movable thing in the room had gone
before her. After that she made no further resistance,
but suffered Bertha to wrap her waterproof around her,
and was then carried by Rex and deposited upon one
end of a table, where she lay, too much frightened to
move, with Rex supporting her on one side and Bertha
on the other. And still the storm raged on, and the
white faces grew whiter as the question was asked,
“What will the end be?” In every heart there was a
prayer, and Rex’s mind went back to that night at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Homestead and the prayers for those in peril on the
deep. Were they praying now, and would their prayers
avail, or would the sad news go to them that their
loved one was lying far down in the depths of the sea?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, if I could save her!” he thought, moving his
hand along upon the table until it touched and held
hers in a firm clasp which seemed to say, “For life or
death you are mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then Louie began to shiver, and moaned that
she was cold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait a minute, darling,” Bertha said, “and I will
bring you a blanket from our state-room, if I can get
there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was no easy task, for the ship was plunging
fearfully, and always at an angle which made walking
difficult. Twice Bertha fell upon her knees, and once
struck her head against the side of the passage, but she
reached the room at last, and, securing the blanket, was
turning to retrace her steps, when a wave heavier than
any which had preceded it struck the vessel, which
reeled with what one of the sailors called a double X,
pitching and rolling sidewise and endwise and cornerwise
all at once. To stand was impossible, and with a
cry Bertha fell forward into the arms of Rex Hallam.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rex!” she said, involuntarily, and “Bertha!” he
replied, showering kisses upon her face, down which
the tears were running like rain.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had been gone so long that he had become
alarmed at her absence, and with great difficulty had
made his way to the state-room, which he reached in
time to save her from a heavy fall. Both were thrown
upon the lounge under the window, where they sat for
a moment, breathless and forgetful of their danger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Bertha was the first to speak, saying she must go to
Louie, but Rex held her fast, and, steadying himself as
best he could, drew her face close to his, and said,
“This is not a time for love-making, but I may never
have another chance, and, if we must die, death will be
robbed of half its terrors if you are with me, my darling,
my queen, whom I believe I have loved ever since
I saw your photograph and thought it was poor Rose
Arabella Jefferson.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He could not repress a smile at the remembrance of
that scion of the Jeffersons, but Bertha did not see it.
Her head was lying upon his breast, and he was holding
to the side of the door to keep from being thrown
upon the floor as he urged his suit and then waited for
her answer. Against the windows and the dead-lights
the waves were dashing furiously, while overhead was
a roar like heavy cannonading, mingled with the hoarse
shouts of voices calling through the storm. But Rex
heard Bertha’s answer, and at the peril of his limbs
folded her in his arms and said, “Now we live or die
together; and I think that we shall live.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally they forgot the blanket and everything else
as they groped their way back to the door of the salon,
where Rex stopped suddenly at the sound of a voice
heard distinctly enough for him to know that some one
was praying loudly and earnestly, and to know, too,
who it was whose clear, nasal tones could be heard
above the din without.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Phineas Jones!” he exclaimed. “Great Cæsar!
how came he here?” And he struggled in with Bertha
to get nearer to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Phineas had been very ill in Liverpool, and when the
Germanic left he was still in bed, and was obliged to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>wait two weeks longer, when he took passage on the
same ship with Mrs. Hallam. Even then he was so
weak that he did not make up his mind to go until an
hour before the ship sailed. As there were few passengers,
he had no difficulty in securing a berth, where
during the first days of the voyage he lay horribly sea-sick
and did not know who were on board. He had
been too late for his name to be included in the passenger-list,
and it was not until the day of the storm that
he learned that Mrs. Hallam and Rex and Bertha were
on the ship. To find them at once was his first impulse,
but when the cyclone struck the boat it struck him, too,
with a fresh attack of sea-sickness, from which he did
not rally until night, when he would not be longer
restrained. Something told him, he said, that Lucy Ann
needed him,—in fact, that they all needed him in the
cabin, and he was going there. And he went, nearly
breaking his neck. Entering the salon on his hands and
knees, he made his way to the end of the table on which
Louie lay, and near which Mrs. Hallam was clinging
desperately to a chair as she crouched upon the floor.
It was at this moment that the double X which had sent
Bertha into Rex’s arms struck the ship, eliciting shrieks
of terror from the passengers, who felt that the end had
come. Steadying himself against a corner of the table,
Phineas called out, in a loud, penetrating voice:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Silence! This is no time to scream and cry. It is
action you want. Pray to be delivered, as Jonah did.
The captain and crew are doing their level best on deck.
Let us do ours here, and don’t you worry. We shall be
heard. The Master who stilled the storm on Galilee is
in this boat, and not asleep, either, in the hindermost
part. If He was, no human could get to Him, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>ship nearly bottom side up. He is in our midst. I
know it, I feel it; and you who are too scart to pray,
and you who don’t know how, listen to me. Let us
pray.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The effect was electric, and every head was bowed as
Phineas began the most remarkable prayer which was
ever offered on shipboard. He was in deadly earnest,
and, fired with the fervor and eloquence which made
him so noted as a class-leader, he informed the Lord of
the condition they were in and instructed Him how to
improve it. Galilee, he said, was nothing to the Atlantic
when on a tear as it was now, but the voice which had
quieted the waters of Tiberias could stop this uproar.
He presumed some of them ought to be drowned, he
said, but they didn’t want to be, and were going to do
better. Then he confessed every possible sin which
might have been committed by the passengers, who,
according to his statement, were about the wickedest
lot, take them as a whole, that ever crossed the
ocean. There were exceptions, of course. There were
near and dear friends of his, and one blood kin, on
board, for whom he especially asked aid. He had not
looked upon the face of his kinswoman for years, but he
had never forgotten the sweet counsel they took together
when children in Sturbridge, and he would have her
saved anyway. Like himself, she was old and stricken
in years, but——</p>

<p class='c012'>“Horrible!” came in muffled tones from something
at his feet, and, looking down, he saw the bundle of
shawls, which, in its excitement, had loosened its hold
on the chair and was rolling down the inclined plane
towards the centre of the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>Reaching out his long arm, he pulled it back, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>putting his foot against it, went on with what was now
a prayer of thanksgiving. Those who have been in a
storm at sea like the one I am describing, will remember
how quick they were to detect a change for the
better, as the blows upon the ship became less frequent
and heavy and the noise overhead began to subside.</p>

<p class='c012'>Phineas was the first to notice it, and, with his foot
still firmly planted against the struggling bundle to
keep it in place, he exclaimed, in a voice which was
almost a shriek:</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are saved! We are saved! Don’t you feel it?
Don’t you hear it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>They did hear it and feel it, and with glad hearts responded
to the words of thanksgiving which Phineas
poured forth, saying the answer to his prayer had come
sooner than he expected, and acknowledging that his
faith had been weak as water. Then he promised a
forsaking of their sins, and a life more consistent with
the doctrine they professed, for them all, adapting himself
as nearly as he could to the forms of worship familiar
to the different denominations he knew must be assembled
there. For the Presbyterians there was a mention
made of foreordination and the Westminster Catechism,
for the Baptists, immersion, for the Methodists,
sanctification, for the Roman Catholics, the Blessed
Virgin; but he forgot the Episcopalians, until, remembering,
with a start, Rex and Lucy Ann, he wound up
with:</p>

<p class='c012'>“From pride, vainglory and hypocrisy, good Lord
deliver us. Amen.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The simple earnestness of the man so impressed his
hearers that no one thought of smiling at his ludicrous
language, and when the danger was really over and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>they could stand upon their feet, they crowded around
him as if he had been their deliverer from deadly peril,
while Rex introduced him as his particular friend.
This stamped him as somebody, and he at once became
a sort of lion. We are all more or less susceptible to
flattery, and Phineas was not an exception; he received
the attentions with a very satisfied air, thinking to himself
that if his recent prayers had so impressed them,
what would they say if they could hear him when fully
under way at a camp-meeting?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where’s your aunt?” he asked Rex, suddenly, while
Rex looked round for her, but could not find her.</p>

<p class='c012'>More dead than alive, Mrs. Hallam had clung to the
chair in momentary expectation of going down, never
to rise again, and in that awful hour it seemed to her
that everything connected with her life had passed before
her. The old, yellow house, the grandmother to
whom she had not always been kind, the early friends
of whom she had been ashamed, the husband she
had loved, but whom she had tried so often, all stood
out so vividly that it seemed as if she could touch
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everything bad,—nothing good. May God forgive
it all!” she whispered more than once, as she lay waiting
for the end and shuddering as she thought of the
dark, cold waters so soon to engulf her.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this state of mind she became conscious that some
one was standing so close to her that his boots held
down a portion of her dress, but she did not mind it, for
at that moment Phineas began his prayer, to which
she listened intently. She knew it was an illiterate
man, that his boots were coarse, that his clothes were
saturated with an odor of cheap tobacco, and that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>belonged to a class which she despised because she had
once been of it. But as he prayed she felt, as she had
never felt before, the Presence he said was there with
him, and thought nothing of his class, or his tobacco,
or his boots. He was a saint, until he spoke of Sturbridge
and his blood kin who was old and stricken in
years. Then she knew who the saint was, and as soon
as it was possible to do so she escaped to her state-room,
where Rex found her in a state of great nervous excitement.
She could not and would not see Phineas
that night, she said. Possibly she might be equal to it
in the morning. With that message Phineas, who was
hovering around her door, was obliged to be content,
but before he retired, every one with whom he talked
knew that Mrs. Hallam was his cousin Lucy Ann,
whom he used to know in Sturbridge when she was a
girl.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='large'>ON SEA AND LAND.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Naturally the captain and officers made light of the
storm after it was over, citing, as a proof that it was
not so very severe, the fact that within four hours after
it began to subside the ship was sailing smoothly over
a comparatively calm sea, on which the moon and stars
were shining as brightly as if it had not so recently
been stirred to its depths. The deck had been cleared,
and, after seeing Louie in her berth, Bertha went up to
join Rex, who was waiting for her. All the past peril
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>was forgotten in the joy of their perfect love, and they
had so much to talk about and so many plans for the
future to discuss that the midnight bells sounded before
they separated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not very long till morning, when I shall see
you again, nor long before you will be all my own,”
Rex said, holding her in his arms and kissing her many
times before he let her go.</p>

<p class='c012'>She found Louie asleep, and when next morning
Bertha arose as the first gong sounded, Louie was still
sleeping, exhausted with the excitement of the previous
day. She was evidently dreaming, for there was a
smile on her lips which moved once with some word
Bertha could not catch, although it sounded like
“Rex.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder if she cares very much for him,” Bertha
thought, with a twinge of pain. “If she does, I cannot
give him up, for he is mine,—my Rex.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She repeated the name aloud, lingering over it as if
the sound were very pleasant to her, and just then
Louie’s blue eyes opened and looked inquiringly at
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it about Rex?” she asked, smiling up at
Bertha in that pretty, innocent way which children
have of smiling when waking from sleep. “Has he
been to inquire for me?” she continued; and, feeling
that she could no longer put it off, Bertha knelt beside
her and told her a story which made the bright color
fade from Louie’s face and her lips quiver in a grieved
kind of way as she listened to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>When it was finished she did not say a word, except
to ask if it was not very cold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am all in a shiver. I think I will not get up. Tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Martha not to come to me. I do not want any breakfast,”
she said, as she turned her face to the wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a moment Bertha lingered, perplexed and pained,—then
started to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait,” Louie called, faintly, and when Bertha went
to her she flung her arms around her neck and said,
with a sob, “I am glad for you, and I know you will be
happy. Tell Rex I congratulate him. And now go and
don’t come back for ever so long. I am tired and want
to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When she was alone, the little woman buried her face
in the pillows and cried like a child, trying to believe
she was crying for her husband, but failing dismally.
It was for Rex, whom she had held dearer than she
knew, and whom she had lost. But with all her weakness
Louie had a good deal of common sense, which
soon came to her aid. “This is absurd,—crying for one
who does not care for me except as a friend. I’ll be a
woman, and not a baby,” she thought, as she rung for
Martha to come and dress her. An hour later she surprised
Bertha and Rex, who were sitting on a seat at
the head of the stairs, with a rug thrown across their
laps, concealing the hands clasped so tightly beneath it.
Nothing could have been sweeter than her manner as
she congratulated Rex verbally, and then, sitting down
by them, began to plan the grand wedding she would
give them if they would wait until poor Fred had been
dead a little longer, say a year.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex had his own ideas about the wedding and waiting,
but he did not express them then. He had settled
in his own mind when he should take Bertha, and that
it would be from the old house in which he began to
have a feeling of ownership.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Meanwhile Mrs. Hallam had consented to see
Phineas, whom Rex took to her state-room. What
passed at the interview no one knew. It did not last
long, and at its close Mrs. Hallam had a nervous headache
and Phineas’s face wore a troubled and puzzled
expression. He would never have known Lucy Ann,
she had altered so, he said. Not grown old, as he supposed
she would, but different somehow. He guessed
she was tuckered out with fright and the storm. She’d
be better when she got home, and then they’d have a
good set-to, talking of the old times. He was going to
visit her a few days.</p>

<p class='c012'>This accounted for her headache which lasted the
rest of the voyage, so that she did not appear again until
they were at the dock in New York. Handing her
keys to Rex, she said, “See to my trunks, and for
heaven’s sake—keep that man from coming to the house,
if you have to strangle him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was among the first to leave the ship, and was
driving rapidly home, while Phineas was squabbling
with a custom-house officer over some jewelry he had
bought in Edinburgh as a present for Dorcas, and an
overcoat in London for Mr. Leighton, and which he had
conscientiously declared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m a class-leader,” he said, “and I’d smile to see
me lie, and when they asked me if I had any presents I
told ’m yes, a coat for the ’Square, and some cangorms
for Dorcas, and I swan if they didn’t make me trot ’em
out and pay duty, too; and they let more’n fifty trunks
full of women’s clothes go through for nothin’. I seen
’m. Where’s Lucy Ann? I was goin’ with her,” he
said to Rex, who could have enlightened him with regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>to the women’s clothes which “went through for
nothin’,” but didn’t.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Jones,” he said, buttonholing him familiarly as
they walked out of the custom-house, “my aunt has
gone home. She is not feeling well at all, and, as the
house is not quite in running order, I do not think
you’d better go there now. I’ll take you to dine at my
club, or, better yet, to the Waldorf, where Mrs. Thurston
and Miss Leighton are to stop, and to-morrow we
will all go on together, for I’m to see Mrs. Thurston
home to Boston, and on my way back shall stop at the
Homestead. I am to marry Miss Bertha.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You be! Well, I’m glad on’t; but I do want to see
Lucy Ann’s house, and I sha’n’t make an atom of
trouble. She expects me,” Phineas said, and Rex replied,
“I hardly think she does. Indeed, I know she
doesn’t, and I wouldn’t go if I were you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Gradually the truth began to dawn upon Phineas,
and there was a pathos in his voice and a moisture in
his eyes as he said, “Is Lucy Ann ashamed of <em>me</em>? I
wouldn’t have believed it, and she my only kin. I’d go
through fire and water to serve her. Tell her so, and
God bless her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rex felt a great pity for the simple-hearted man to
whom the glories of a dinner at the Waldorf did not
quite atone for the loss of Lucy Ann, whom he spoke of
again when after dinner Rex went with him to the hotel,
where he was to spend the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m an awkward critter, I know,” he said, “and not
used to the ways of high society, but I’m respectable,
and my heart is as big as an ox.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Nothing, however, rested long on Phineas’s mind, and
the next morning he was cheerful as ever when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>met his friends at the station, and committed the unwonted
extravagance of taking a chair with them in a
parlor car, saying as he seated himself that he’d never
been in one before, and that he found it tip-top.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='large'>“I, REX, TAKE THEE, BERTHA.”</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The words were said in the old Homestead about a
year from the time when we first saw Bertha walking
along the lane to meet her sister and holding in her hand
the newspaper which had been the means of her meeting
with Rex Hallam. The May day had been perfect
then, and it was perfect now. The air was odorous with
the perfume of the pines and the apple-blossoms, and
the country seemed as fresh and fair as when it first
came from the hands of its Creator. The bequest
which Fred had made to Bertha, and which he wished
he had doubled, had been quadrupled by Louie, who,
when Bertha declined to take so much, had urged it
upon her as a bridal present in advance. With that
understanding Bertha had accepted it, and several
changes had been made in the Homestead, both outside
and in. Bertha’s room, however, where Rex had once
slept, remained intact. This he insisted upon, and it
was in this room that he received his bride from the
hands of her bridesmaids. It was a very quiet affair,
with only a few intimate friends from Worcester and
Leicester, and Mrs. Hallam from New York. Bertha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>had suggested inviting Mrs. Haynes, but Rex vetoed
that decidedly. She had been the direct cause of so much
humiliation to Bertha that he did not care to keep
her acquaintance, he said. But Mrs. Haynes had no
intention to be ignored by the future Mrs. Rex Hallam,
and one of the handsomest presents Bertha received
came from her, with a note of congratulation. Louie
and Phineas were master and mistress of ceremonies,
Louie inside and Phineas outside, where he insisted
upon caring for the horses of those who drove from
Worcester and the village.</p>

<p class='c012'>He’d “smile if he couldn’t do it up ship-shape,” he
said, and he came at an early hour, gorgeous in swallowtail
coat, white vest, stove-pipe hat, and an immense
amount of shirt-front, ornamented with Rhine-stone
studs. In his ignorance he did not know that a dress-coat
was not just as suitable for morning as evening,
and had bought one second-hand at a clothing-store in
Boston. He wanted to make a good impression on
Lucy Ann, he said to Grace, who had been at the Homestead
two or three days, and who, declaring him a most
delicious specimen, had hobnobbed with him quite
familiarly. She told him she had no doubt he would
impress Lucy Ann; and he did, for she came near fainting
when he presented himself to her, asking what she
thought of his outfit, and how it would “do for high.”
She wanted to tell him that he would look far better in
his every-day clothes than in that costume, but restrained
herself and made some non-committal reply. Since
meeting him on the ship she had had time to reflect
that no one whose opinion was really worth caring for
would think less of her because of her relatives, and she
was a little ashamed of her treatment of him. Perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>too, she was softened by the sight of the old homestead,
which had been her husband’s home, or Grace Travis’s
avowal that she wished she had just such a dear codger
of a cousin, might have had some effect in making her
civil and even gracious to the man who, without the
least resentment for her former slight of him, “Cousin
Lucy Ann”-ed her continually and led her up to salute
the bride after the ceremony was over.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a wedding breakfast, superintended by
Louie, who, if she felt any regret for the might-have-been,
did not show it, and was bright and merry as a
bird, talking a little of Fred and a great deal of Charlie
Sinclair, whom business kept from the wedding and
whose lovely present she had helped select. The wedding
trip was to extend beyond the Rockies as far as
Tacoma, and to include the Fair in Chicago on the
homeward journey. The remainder of the summer
was to be spent at the Homestead, where Rex could
hunt and fish and row to his heart’s content, if he could
not have a fox-hunt. Both he and Bertha wished a
home of their own in New York, but Mrs. Hallam
begged so hard for them to stay with her for a year at
least that they consented to do so.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You may be the mistress, or the daughter of the
house, as you please, only stay with me,” Mrs. Hallam
said to Bertha, of whom she seemed very fond.</p>

<p class='c012'>Evidently she was on her best behavior, and during
the few days she stayed at the Homestead she quite won
the hearts of both Mr. Leighton and Dorcas, and greatly
delighted Phineas by asking him to spend the second
week in July with her. In this she was politic and
managing. She knew he was bound to come some time,
and, knowing that the most of her calling acquaintance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>would be out of town in July, she fixed his visit at
that time, making him understand that he could not
prolong it, as she was to join Rex and Bertha in Chicago
on the 15th. Had he been going to visit the queen,
Phineas could not have been more elated or have talked
more about it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope I sha’n’t mortify Lucy Ann to death,” he said,
and when in June Louie came for a few days to the
Homestead, he asked her to give him some points in etiquette,
which he wrote down and studied diligently, till
he considered himself quite equal to cope with any difficulty,
and at the appointed time packed his dress-suit
and started for New York.</p>

<p class='c012'>This was Monday, and on Saturday Dorcas was surprised
to see him walking up the avenue from the car.</p>

<p class='c012'>He’d had a tip-top time, he said, and Lucy Ann did
all she could to make it pleasant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, my!” he added, “it was so lonesome and
grand and stiff; and didn’t Lucy Ann put on the
style! But I studied my notes, and held my own pretty
well. I don’t think I made more than three or four
blunders. I reached out and got a piece of bread with
my fork, and saw a thunder-cloud on Lucy Ann’s face;
and I put on my dress-suit one morning to drive to the
Park, but took it off quicker when Lucy Ann saw it.
Dress-coats ain’t the thing in the morning, it seems.
I guess they ain’t the thing for me anywhere. But my
third blunder was wust of all, though I don’t understand
it. Between you ’n’ I, I don’t believe Lucy Ann has
much company, for not a livin’ soul come to the house
while I was there, except one woman with two men in
tall boots drivin’ her. Lucy Ann was out and the nigger
was out, and I went to the door to save the girls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>from runnin’ up and down stairs so much. I told her
Mis’ Hallam wa’n’t to home, and I rather urged her to
come in and take a chair, she looked so kind of disappointed
and tired, and curi’s, too, I thought, as if she
wondered who I was; so I said, ‘I’m Mis’ Hallam’s
cousin. You better come in and rest. She’ll be home
pretty soon.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Thanks,’ she said, in a queer kind of way, and
handed me a card for Lucy Ann, who was tearin’ when
I told her what I’d done. It was the servants’ business
to wait on the door when Peters was out, she said, and
on no account was I to ask any one in if she wasn’t
there. That ain’t my idea of hospitality. Is’t yours?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorcas laughed, and said she supposed city ways
were not exactly like those of the country. Phineas
guessed they wasn’t, and he was glad to get where he
could tip back in his chair if he wanted to, and eat with
his knife, and ask a friend to come in and sit down.</p>

<p class='c012'>A few days later Dorcas and her father, with Louie,
started for Chicago to join the Hallams. For four
weeks they reveled in the wonders of the beautiful
White City. After that Mrs. Hallam returned to her
lonely house in New York, while Rex and Bertha and
Louie went back to the old Homestead. There they
spent the remainder of the summer, and there Bertha
lingered until the hazy light of October was beginning
to hang over the New England hills and the autumnal
tints to show in the woods. Then Rex, who had spent
every Sunday there, took her to her new home, where
her reception was very different from what it had been
on her first arrival. Then she was only a hired companion,
dining with the housekeeper and waiting on
the fourth floor back for her employer to give her an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>audience. Now she was a petted bride, the daughter
of the house, with full authority to go where she pleased,
do what she pleased, and make any change she pleased,
from the drawing-room to the handsome suite which
had been fitted up for her. But she made no change,
except in Rex’s sleeping-apartment, where she did
take the pictures of ballet-dancers, rope-walkers, and
sporting men from the mirror-frame, and substituted
in their place those of her father, Dorcas, and
Grace. She would have liked to remove her own
picture, with “Rose Arabella Jefferson” written upon
it, but Rex interfered. It seemed to him, he said, a
connecting link between his bachelor life and the great
joy which had come to him, and it should stay there,
Rose Arabella and all.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Leighton and Dorcas have twice visited Bertha
in her home, and been happy there because she was so
happy. But both were glad to go back to the old house
under the apple-trees and the country life which they
like best. Bertha, on the contrary, takes readily to the
ways of the great city, although she cares but little for
the fashionable society that is so eager to take her up,
and prefers the companionship of her husband and the
quiet of her home to the gayest assemblage in New
York. Occasionally however, she may be seen at some
afternoon tea, or dinner, or reception, where Mrs.
Hallam is proud to introduce her as “my nephew’s
wife,” while Mrs. Walker Haynes, always politic and
persistent, speaks of her as “my friend, that charming
Mrs. Reginald Hallam.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE SPRING FARM.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>AT THE FARM HOUSE.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was a very pleasant, homelike old farm house,
standing among the New England hills, with the summer
sunshine falling upon it, and the summer air,
sweet with the perfume of roses and June pinks, filling
the wide hall and great square rooms, where, on the
morning when our story opens, the utmost confusion
prevailed. Carpets were up; curtains were down;
huge boxes were standing everywhere, while into them
two men and a boy were packing the furniture scattered
promiscuously around, for on the morrow the
family, who had owned and occupied the house so long,
were to leave the premises and seek another home in the
little village about two miles away. In one of the
lower rooms in the wing to the right, where the sunshine
was the brightest and the rose-scented air the
sweetest, a white-faced woman lay upon a couch looking
at and listening to a lady who sat talking to her, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>money and pride and selfishness stamped upon her as
plainly as if the words had been placarded upon her
back. The lady was Mrs. Marshall-More, of Boston,
whose handsome country house was not far from the
red farm house, which, with its rich, well-cultivated
acres, had, by the foreclosure of a mortgage she held
upon it, recently come into her possession, or rather
into that of her half brother, who had bidden it off for
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Marshall-More had once been plain Mrs. John
More, but since her husband’s death, she had prefixed
her maiden name, with a hyphen to the More, making
herself Mrs. Marshall-More, which, she thought, had a
very aristocratic look and sound. She was a great lady
in her own immediate circle of friends in the city, and
a greater lady in Merrivale, where she passed her summers,
and her manner toward the little woman on the
couch was one of infinite superiority and patronage,
mingled with a show of interest and pity. She had
driven to the farm house that morning, ostensibly to
say good-bye to the family, but really to go over the
place which she had coveted so long as a most desirable
adjunct to her possessions. What she was saying
to the white-faced woman in the widow’s cap was
this:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am very sorry for you, Mrs. Graham, and I hope
you do not blame me for foreclosing the mortgage. I
had to have the money, for Archie’s college expenses
will be very heavy, and then I am going to Europe this
summer, and I did not care to draw from my other investments.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no, I blame no one, but it is very hard all the
same to leave the old home where I have been so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>happy,” Mrs. Graham replied, and Mrs. Marshall-More
went on: “I am glad to hear you say so, for the Merrivale
people have been very ill-natured about it and I
have heard more than once that I hastened the foreclosure
and intend to tear down the old house and
build a cottage, which is false.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To this Mrs. Graham made no reply, and Mrs. Marshall-More
continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will be much better off in the village than in
this great rambling house, and your children will find
employment there. Maude must be eighteen, and
ought to be a great help to you. I hear she is a sentimental
dreamer, living mostly in the clouds with people
only known to herself, and perhaps she needed this
change to rouse her to the realities of life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maude is the dearest girl in the world,” was the
mother’s quick protest against what seemed like disapprobation
of her daughter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, of course,” was Mrs. Marshall-More’s response.
“Maude is a nice girl and a pretty girl and will be a
great comfort to you when she wakes up to the fact
that life is earnest and not all a dream, and in time you
will be quite as happy in your new home as you could be
here, where it must be very dreary in the winter, when
the snow-drifts are piled up to the very window ledges,
and the wind screams at you through every crevice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh-h,” Mrs. Graham said, with a shudder, her
thoughts going back to the day when the blinding snow
had come down in great billows upon the newly-made
grave in which she left her husband, and went back
alone to the desolate home where he would never come
again.</p>

<p class='c012'>It had been so terrible and sudden, his going from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>her. Well in the morning, and dead at night; killed
by a locomotive and brought to her so mangled that she
could never have recognized him as her husband. People
had called him over-generous and extravagant, and
perhaps he was, but the money he spent so lavishly was
always for others, and not for himself, and as the holder
of the heavy mortgage on his farm had been content
with the interest and never pressed his claim, he had
made no effort to lessen it, even after he knew it passed
into the hands of Mrs. Marshall-More, who had often
expressed a wish to own the place known as the Spring
Farm, and so-called from the numerous springs upon
it. She would fill it with her city friends and set up
quite an English establishment, she said; and now it
was hers, to all intents and purposes, for though the
deed was in her brother’s name, it was understood that
she was mistress of the place and could do what she
liked with it. Of the real owner, Max Gordon, her half-brother,
little was known, except the fact that he was
very wealthy and had for years been engaged to a lady
who, by a fall from a horse, had been crippled for life.
It was also rumored that the lady had insisted upon releasing
her lover from his engagement, but he had refused
to be released, and still clung to the hope that she
would eventually recover. Just where he was at present,
nobody knew. He seldom visited his sister, although
she was very proud of him and very fond of
talking of her brother Max, who, she said, was so generous
and good, although a little queer. He had bidden
off the Spring Farm because she asked him to do so, and
a few thousand dollars more or less were nothing to
him; then, telling her to do what she liked with it, he
had gone his way, while poor Lucy Graham’s heart was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>breaking at the thought of leaving the home which her
husband had made so beautiful for her. An old-fashioned
place, it is true, but one of those old-fashioned
places to which our memory clings fondly, and our
thoughts go back with an intense longing years after
the flowers we have watered are dead, and the shrubs
we have planted are trees pointing to the sky. A great
square house, with a wing on either side, a wide hall
through the center and a fireplace in every room. A
well-kept lawn in front, dotted with shade trees and
flowering shrubs, and on one side of it a running brook,
fed by a spring on the hillside to the west; borders and
beds and mounds of flowers;—tulips and roses and
pansies and pinks and peonies and lilies and geraniums
and verbenas, each blossoming in its turn and making
the garden and grounds a picture of beauty all the
summer long. No wonder that Lucy Graham loved it
and shrank from leaving it, and shrank, too, from Mrs.
Marshall-More’s attempts at consolation, saying only
when that lady arose to go, “It was kind in you to come
and I thank you for it; but just now my heart aches
too hard to be comforted. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-bye, I shall call when you get settled in town,
and if I can be of any service to you I will gladly do
so,” Mrs. Marshall-More said, as she left the room and
went out to her carriage, where she stood for a moment
looking up and down the road, and saying to herself,
“Where can Archie be?”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>WHERE ARCHIE WAS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A long lane wound away to the westward across a
strip of land called the mowing lot, through a bit of
woods and on to a grassy hillside, where, under the
shade of a butternut tree, a pair of fat, sleek oxen were
standing with a look of content in their large, bright
eyes as if well pleased with this unwonted freedom
from the plough and the cart. Against the side of one
of them a young girl was leaning, with her arm thrown
across its neck and her hand caressing the long, white
horn of the dumb creature which seemed to enjoy it. The
girl was Maude Graham, and she made a very pretty
picture as she stood there with her short, brown hair
curling in soft rings about her forehead; her dark blue
eyes, her bright, glowing face, and a mouth which
looked as if made for kisses and sweetness rather than
the angry words she was hurling at the young man, or
boy, for he was only twenty, who stood before her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Archie More,” she was saying, “I don’t think it very
nice in you to talk to me in that patronizing kind of
way, as if you were so much my superior in everything,
and trying to convince me that it is nothing for us to
give up the dear old place where every stone and stump
means somebody to me, for I know them all and have
talked with them all, and called them by name, just as
I know all the maiden ferns and water lilies and where
the earliest arbutus blossoms in the spring. Oh, Archie,
how can I leave Spring Farm and never come back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>again! I think I hate you all for taking it from us, and
especially your uncle Max.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here she broke down entirely, and laying her face
on the shining coat of the ox began to cry as if her heart
would break, while Archie looked at her in real distress
wondering what he should say. He was a city-bred
young man, with a handsome, boyish face, and in a way
very fond of Maude, whom he had known ever since he
was thirteen and she eleven, and he first came to Merrivale
to spend the summer. They had played and
fished together in the brook, and rowed together on the
pond and quarreled and made up, and latterly they had
flirted a little, too, although Archie was careful that the
flirting should not go too far, for he felt that there
was a vast difference between Archie More, son of Mrs.
Marshall-More, and Maude Graham, daughter of a
country farmer. And still he thought her the sweetest,
prettiest girl he had ever seen, a <em>jolly lot</em> he called her,
and he writhed under her bitter words, and when she
cried he tried to comfort her and explain matters as
best he could. But Maude was not to be appeased.
She had felt all the time that the place need not have
been sold, that it was a hasty thing, and though she did
not blame Archie, she was very sore against Mrs. Marshall-More
and her brother, and her only answer to all
Archie could say, was:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You needn’t talk. I hate you all, and your uncle
Max the most, and if I ever see him I’ll tell him so, and
if I don’t you may tell him for me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Archie could keep silent and hear his mother blamed
and himself, but he roused in defense of his uncle Max.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hate my uncle Max,” he exclaimed. “Why, he is
the best man that ever lived, and the kindest. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>knew nothing of you, or how you’d feel, when he bought
the place; if he had he wouldn’t have done it; and if
he could see you now, crying on that ox’s neck, he would
give it back to you. That would be just like him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As if I’d take it,” Maude said, scornfully, as she lifted
up her head and dashed the tears from her eyes with a
rapid movement of both hands. “No, Archie More, I
shall never take Spring Farm as a gift from any one,
much less from your uncle Max; but I shall buy it of
him some day if he keeps it long enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You?” Archie asked, and Maude replied, “Yes, I,
why not? I know I am poor now, but I shall not
always be so. People call me crazy, a dreamer, a crank,
and all that, because they cannot see what I see; the
people who are with me always, my friends; and I
know their names and how they look and where they
live; Mrs. Kimbrick, with her fifty daughters, all Eliza
Anns, and Mrs. Webster, with her fifty daughters, all
Ann Elizas, and Angeline Mason, who comes and talks
to me in the twilight, wearing a yellow dress; they are
real to me as you are, and do you think I am crazy and
a crank because of that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Archie said he didn’t, but he looked a little suspiciously
at the girl standing there so erect, her eyes shining
with a strange light as she talked to him of things
he could not understand. He had heard of this Mrs.
Kimbrick and Mrs. Webster before, with their fifty
daughters each, and had thought Maude queer, to say
the least. He was sure of it now as she went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is the earth crazy because there is in it a little
acorn which you can’t see, but which is still there,
maturing and taking root for the grand old oak, whose
branches will one day give shelter to many a tired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>head? Of course not; neither am I, and some time
these brain children, or brain seeds, call them what you
like, will take shape and grow, and the world will hear
of them, and of me; and you and your mother will be
proud to say you knew me once, when the people praise
the book I am going to write.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A book!” and Archie laughed incredulously, it
seemed so absurd that little Maude Graham should ever
become an author of whom the world would hear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” she answered him decidedly. “A book!
Why not? It is in me; it has been there always, and I
can no more help writing it than you can help doing,—well,
nothing, as you always have. Yes, I shall write a
book, and you will read it, Archie More, and thousands
more, too; and I shall put Spring Farm in it, and you,
and your uncle Max. I think I shall make him the
villain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was very hard upon poor Max, whose only
offense was that he had bidden off Spring Farm to
please his sister, but Archie was ready to defend him
again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you knew uncle Max,” he said, “you would make
him your hero instead of your villain, for a better man
never lived. He is kindness itself and the soul of honor.
Why, when he was very young he was engaged to a
girl who fell from a horse and broke her leg, or her
neck, or her back, I’ve forgotten which. Anyhow, she
cannot walk and has to be wheeled in a chair, but Max
sticks to her like a burr, because he thinks he ought. I
am sure I hope he will never marry her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not?” Maude asked, and he replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because, you see, Max has a heap of money, and if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>he never marries and I outlive him, some of it will come
to me. Money is a good thing, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t suppose you as mean as that, Archie More!
and I hope Mr. Max will marry that broken-backed
woman, and that she will live a thousand years! Yes,
I do!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The last three words were emphasized with so vigorous
blows on the back of the ox, that he started away
suddenly, and Maude would have fallen if Archie had
not caught her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, Maude,” he said, as he held her for a moment
closely to him, “don’t let’s quarrel any more. I’m
going away to-morrow to the Adirondacks, then in the
fall to college, and may not see you again for a long
time; but I sha’n’t forget you. I like you the best of
any girl in the world; I do, upon my honor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, you don’t. I know exactly what you think of
me, and always have, but it does not matter now,”
Maude answered vehemently. “You are going your
way, and I am going mine, and the two ways will never
meet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so, quarreling and making up, but making up
rather more than they quarreled, the two went slowly
along the gravelly lane until they reached the house
where Mrs. Marshall-More was standing with a very
severe look upon her face, as she said to her son:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know how long you have kept me waiting?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then to Maude:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Been crying? I am sorry you take it so hard. Believe
me, you will be better off in the village. Neither
your mother nor you could run the farm, and you will
find some employment there. I hear that Mrs. Nipe is
wanting an apprentice and that she will give small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>wages at first, which is not usual with dressmakers.
You’d better apply at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you,” Maude answered quickly. “I do not
think I shall learn dressmaking,” and Maude looked at
the lady as proudly as a queen might look upon her
subject. “Mrs. More, do you think your brother would
promise to keep Spring Farm until I can buy it back?”
she continued.</p>

<p class='c012'>The idea that Maude Graham could ever buy Spring
Farm was so preposterous that Mrs. Marshall-More
laughed immoderately, as she replied, “Perhaps so. I
will ask him; or you can do it yourself. I don’t know
where he is now. I seldom do know, but anything addressed
to his club, No. —, —— Street, Boston, will
reach him in time. And now we must go. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She offered the tips of her fingers to the girl who just
touched them, and then giving her hand to Archie said,
“Good-bye, Archie, I am sorry we quarreled so, and I
did not mean half I said to you. I hope you will forget
it. Good-bye; I may never see you again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If Archie had dared he would have kissed the face
which had never looked so sweet to him as now; but
his mother’s eyes were upon him and so he only said
“Good-bye,” and took his seat in the carriage with a
feeling that something which had been very dear had
dropped out of his life.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>GOING WEST.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was a very plain but pretty little cottage of which
Mrs. Graham took possession with her children, Maude
and John, who was two years younger than his sister.
As most of the furniture had been sold it did not take
them long to settle, and then the question arose as to
how they were to live. A thousand dollars was all they
had in the world, and these Mrs. Graham placed in the
savings bank against a time of greater need, hoping
that, as her friends assured her, something would turn
up. “If there was anything I could do, I would do it
so willingly,” Maude was constantly saying to herself,
while busy with the household duties which now fell to
her lot and to which she was unaccustomed. During
her father’s life two strong German girls had been employed
in the house and Maude had been as tenderly
and delicately reared as are the daughters of millionaires.
But now everything was changed, and those
who had known her only as an idle dreamer and devourer
of books, were astonished at the energy and capability
which she developed. But these did not understand
the girl or know that all the stronger part of her
nature had been called into being by the exigencies of
the case. Maude’s love for her mother was deep and
unselfish, and for her sake she tried to make the most
and the best of everything. Stifling with a smile born
of a sob all her longings for the past, she turned her
thoughts steadily to the one purpose of her life,—buying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Spring Farm back! But how? The book she was
going to write did not seem quite so certain now. Her
brain children had turned traitors and flown away from
the sweeping, dusting, dishwashing and bedmaking
which fell to her lot and which she did with a song on
her lips lest her mother should detect the heartache
which was always with her, even when her face was the
brightest and her song the sweetest. She had written
to Archie’s uncle without a suspicion that she did not
know his real name. As he was a brother of Mrs.
More, whose maiden name was Marshall, his must be
Marshall too, she reasoned, forgetting to have heard
that Mrs. More was only a half-sister and that there had
been two fathers. Of course, he was Max Marshall,
and she addressed him as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Merrivale</span>, July —, 18—.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Max Marshall</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—I am Maude Graham, and you bought
my old home, Spring Farm, and it nearly broke my
own and mamma’s heart to have it sold. I don’t blame
you much now for buying it, but I did once, and I said
some hard things about you to Archie More, your
nephew, which he may repeat to you. But I was
angry then at him and everybody, and I am sorry that
I said them. I am only eighteen and very poor, but I
shall be rich some day,—I am sure of it,—and able to
buy Spring Farm, and I want you to keep it for me and
not sell it to any one else. It may be years, but the
day will come when I shall have the money of my own.
Will you keep the place till then? I think I shall be
happier and have more courage to work if you write
and say you will.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>

      <div class='line'>“Yours truly,      “<span class='sc'>Maude Graham</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>After this letter was sent and before she had reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to expect an answer, Maude began to look for it, but
none came, and the summer stretched on into August
and the house at Spring Farm was shut up, for Mrs.
Marshall-More was in Europe, and Maude’s great
anxiety was to find something to do for her own and
her mother’s support. Miss Nipe, the dressmaker,
would give her a dollar a week while she was learning
the trade, and this, with the three dollars per week
which her brother John was earning in a grocery store,
would be better than nothing, and she was seriously
considering the matter, when a letter from her mother’s
brother, who lived “out West,” as that portion of New
York between the Cayuga Bridge and Buffalo was then
called, changed the whole aspect of her affairs and
forged the first link in the chain of her destiny. He
could not take his sister and her children into his own
large family, he wrote, but he had a plan to propose
which, he thought, would prove advantageous to
Maude, if her mother approved of it and would spare
her from home. About six miles from his place was a
school, which his daughter had taught for two years,
but as she was about to be married, the position was
open to Maude at four dollars a week and her board,
provided she would take it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maude is rather young, I know,” Mr. Ailing wrote in
conclusion, “but no younger than Annie was when she
began to teach, so her age need not stand in the way, if
she chooses to come. The country will seem new and
strange to her; there are still log-houses in the Bush
district; indeed, the school-house is built of logs and
the people ride in lumber wagons and are not like
Bostonians or New Yorkers, but they are very kind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and Maude will get accustomed to them in time. My
advice is that she accept.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At first Mrs. Graham refused to let her young daughter
go so far from home, but Maude was persistent and
eager. Log-houses and lumber wagons had no terrors
for her. Indeed, they were rather attractions than
otherwise, and fired her imagination, which began at
once to people those houses of the olden time with the
Kimbricks and the Websters, who had forsaken her so
long. Four dollars a week seemed a fortune to her,
and she would save it all, she said, and send it to her
mother, who unwillingly consented at last and fortunately
found a gentleman in town who was going to
Chicago and would take charge of Maude as far as
Canandaigua, where she was to leave the train and
finish her journey by stage. But on the evening of the
day before the one when Maude was to start, the gentleman
received word that his son was very ill in Portland
and required his immediate presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can go alone,” Maude said courageously, though
with a little sinking of the heart. “No one will
harm me. Crossing the river at Albany is the worst,
but I can do as the rest do, and after that I do not leave
the car again until we reach Canandaigua.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t feel so badly, mamma,” she continued, winding
her arms around her mother’s neck and kissing
away her tears. “I am not afraid, and don’t you know
how often you have said that God cared for the fatherless,
and I am that, and I shall ask Him all the time I
am in the car to take care of me, and He will answer.
He will hear. I’m not a child. I am eighteen in the
Bible and a great deal older than that since father died.
Don’t cry, darling mamma, and make it harder for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>me. I must go to-morrow, for school begins next
Monday.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So, for her daughter’s sake, Mrs. Graham tried to be
calm, and Maude’s little hair trunk was packed with the
garments, in each of which was folded a mother’s
prayer for the safety of her child; and the morning
came, and the ticket was bought, and the conductor,
with whom Mrs. Graham had a slight acquaintance,
promised to see to the little girl as far as Albany, where
he would put her in charge of the man who took his
place. Then the good-byes were said and the train
moved on past the village on the hillside, past the dear
old Spring Farm which she looked at through blinding
tears as long as a tree-top was in sight, past the graveyard
where her father was lying, past the meadows and
woods and hills she loved so well, and on towards the
new country and the new life of which she knew so
little.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>ON THE ROAD.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Those were the days when the Boston train westward-bound
moved at a snail’s pace compared with
what it does now, and twenty-four hours instead of
twelve were required for the trip from Merrivale to
Canandaigua, so that the afternoon was drawing to a
close when the cars stopped in Greenbush and the passengers
alighted and rushed for the boat which was to
take them across the river. This, and re-checking her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>trunk, was what Maude dreaded the most, and her face
was very white and scared and her heart beating violently
as she followed the crowd, wondering if she
should ever find her trunk among all that pile of baggage
they were handling so roughly, and if it would be
smashed to pieces when she did, and if she should get
into the right car, or be carried somewhere else. She
had lost sight of the conductor. Her head was beginning
to ache, and there was a lump in her throat
every time she thought of her mother and John, who
would soon be taking their simple evening meal and
talking of her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder if I can bear it,” she said to herself, as she
sat in the cabin the very image of despair, clasping her
hand-bag tightly and looking anxiously at the people
around her as if in search of some friendly face, which
she could trust.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had heard so much before leaving home of
wolves in sheep’s or rather men’s clothing, who infest
railway trains, ready to pounce upon any unsuspecting
girl who chanced to fall in their way, and had been so
much afraid that some of the wolves might be on her
train, lying in wait for her, that she had resolutely kept
her head turned to the window all the time with a
prayer in her heart that God would let no one speak to
and frighten her. And thus far no one had spoken to
her, except the conductor, but God must have deserted
her now, for just as they were reaching the opposite
shore, a gentleman, who had been watching her ever
since she crouched down in the shadowy corner, and
who had seen her wipe the tears away more than once,
came up to her and said, “Are you alone, and can I do
anything for you?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Yes,—no; oh, I don’t know,” Maude gasped as she
clutched her bag, in which was her purse, more tightly,
and looked up at the face above her.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was such a pleasant face, and the voice was so kind
and reassuring, that she forgot the wolves and might
have given him her bag, purse, check and all, if the conductor
had not just then appeared and taken her in
charge. Lifting his hat politely the stranger walked
away, while Maude went to identify her trunk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you take a sleeper?” the conductor asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>And she replied: “Oh, no. I can’t afford that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So he found her a whole seat in the common car, and
telling her he would speak of her to the new conductor,
bade her good-bye, and she was left alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Very nervously she watched her fellow passengers as
they came hurrying in,—men, mostly, it seemed to her,—rough-looking
men, too, for there had been a horserace
that day at a point on the Harlem road, and they
were returning from it. Occasionally some one of them
stopped and looked at the girl in black, who sat so
straight and still, with her hand-bag held down upon
the vacant seat beside her as if to keep it intact. But
no one offered to take it, and Maude breathed more
freely as the crowded train moved slowly from the
depot. After a little the new conductor came and spoke
to her and looked at her ticket and went out, and then
she was really alone. New England, with its rocks and
hills and mountains, was behind her. Mother, and
John, and home were far away, and the lump in her
throat grew larger, and there crept over her such a
sense of dreariness and homesickness, that she would
have cried outright if she dared to. There were only
six women in the car besides herself. All the rest were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span><em>wolves</em>; she felt sure of that, they talked and laughed so
loud, and spit so much tobacco-juice. They were so
different from the stranger on the boat, she thought,
wondering who he was and where he had gone. How
pleasantly he had spoken to her, and how she wished——She
got no further, for a voice said to her:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can I sit by you? Every other seat is taken.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, oh, yes. I am so glad,” Maude exclaimed involuntarily
in her delight at recognizing the stranger,
and springing to her feet she offered him the seat next
to the window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” he said, with a smile which would have
won the confidence of any girl. “Keep that yourself.
You will be more comfortable there. Are you going
to ride all night?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I am going to Canandaigua,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To Canandaigua!” he repeated, looking at her a
little curiously; but he asked no more questions then,
and busied himself with adjusting his bag and his large
traveling shawl, which last he put on the back of the
seat,, more behind Maude than himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then he took out a magazine, while Maude watched
him furtively, thinking him the finest looking man she
had ever seen, except her father, of whom, in his manner,
he reminded her a little. Not nearly so old, certainly,
as her father, and not young like Archie either,
for there were a few threads of grey in his mustache
and in his brown hair which had a trick of curling
slightly at the ends under his soft felt hat. Who was
he? she wondered. The initials on his satchel were
“M. G.,” but that told her nothing. How she hoped he
was going as far as she was, she felt so safe with him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>and at last, as the darkness increased and he shut up
his book, she ventured to ask:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you going far?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he replied, with a twinkle of humor in his
blue eyes, “and if none of these men get out, I am
afraid I shall have to claim your forbearance all night,
but I will make myself as small as possible. Look,”
and with a laugh he drew himself close to the arm of
the seat, leaving quite a space between them; but he
did not tell her that he had engaged a berth in the
sleeper, which he had abandoned when he found her
there alone, with that set of roughs, whose character he
knew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these ye have done it unto me,” would surely be said to
him some day, for he was always giving the cup of
water, even to those who did not know they were thirsting
until after they had drunk of what he offered them.
Once he brought Maude some water in a little glass
tumbler, which he took from his satchel, and once he
offered her an apple which she declined lest she should
seem too forward; then, as the hours crept on and her
eyelids began to droop, he folded his shawl carefully
and made her let him put it behind her head, suggesting
that she remove her hat, as she would rest more
comfortably without it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now sleep quietly,” he said, and as if there were
something mesmeric in his voice, Maude went to sleep
at once and dreamed she was at home with her mother
beside her, occasionally fixing the pillow under her
head and covering her with something which added to
her comfort.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was the stranger’s light overcoat which, as the September
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>night grew cold and chill, he put over the girl,
whose upturned face he had studied as intently as she
had studied his. About seven o’clock the conductor
came in, lantern in hand, and as its rays fell upon the
stranger, he said, “Hello, Gordon, you here? I thought
you were in the sleeper. On guard, I see, as usual.
Who is the lamb this time?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know; do you?” the man called Gordon replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” the conductor said, turning his light full upon
Maude; then, “Why, it’s a little girl the Boston conductor
put in my care; but she’s safer with you. Comes
from the mountains somewhere, I believe. Guess she is
going to seek her fortune. She ought to find it, with
that face. Isn’t she pretty?” and he glanced admiringly
at the sweet young face now turned to one side, with
one hand under the flushed cheek and the short rings
of damp hair curling round her forehead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, very,” Gordon replied, moving uneasily and
finally holding a newspaper between Maude and the
conductor’s lantern, for it did not seem right to him
that any eyes except those of a near friend should take
this advantage of a sleeping girl.</p>

<p class='c012'>The conductor passed on, and then Gordon fell asleep
until they reached a way station, where the sudden
stopping of a train roused him to consciousness, and a
moment after he was confronted by a young man, who,
at sight of him, stopped short and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Max Gordon, as I live! I’ve hunted creation over
for you and given you up. Where have you been and
why weren’t you at Long Branch, as you said you’d be
when you wrote me to join you there?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“Got tired of it, you were so long coming, so I went
to the Adirondacks with Archie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you bring me any letters?” Max replied, and
his friend continued, “Yes, a cart load. Six, any way,”
and he began to take them from his side pocket. “One,
two, three, four, five; there’s another somewhere. Oh,
here ’tis,” he said, taking out the sixth, which looked
rather soiled and worn. “I suppose it’s for you,” he
continued, “although it’s directed to Mr. Max Marshall,
Esq., and is in a school-girl’s handwriting. It came
long ago, and we chaps puzzled over it a good while;
then, as no one appeared to claim it, and it was mailed
at Merrivale, where your sister spends her summers, I
ventured to bring it with the rest. If you were not
such a saint I’d say you had been imposing a false
name upon some innocent country girl, and, by George,
I believe she’s here now with your ulster over her!
Running off with her, eh? What will Miss Raynor
say?” he went on, as his eyes fell upon Maude, who
just then stirred in her sleep and murmured softly,
“Our Father, who art in Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was at home in her little white-curtained bedroom,
kneeling with her mother and saying her nightly
prayer, and, involuntarily, both the young men bowed
their heads as if receiving a benediction.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think, Dick, that your vile insinuation is answered,”
Max said, and Dick rejoined, “Yes, I beg your
pardon. Under your protection, I s’pose. Well, she’s
safe; but I must be finding that berth of mine. Will
see you in the morning. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He left the car, while Max Gordon tried to read his
letters as best he could by the dim light near him.
One was from his sister, one from Archie, three on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>business, while the last puzzled him a little, and he held
it awhile as if uncertain as to his right to open it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must be for me,” he said at last, and breaking the
seal he read Maude’s letter to him, unconscious that
Maude was sleeping there beside him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed, he had never heard of Maude Graham before,
and had scarcely given a thought to the former owners
of Spring Farm. His sister had a mortgage upon it;
the man was dead; the place must be sold, and Mrs.
More asked him to buy it; that was all he knew when
he bid it off.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor little girl,” he said to himself. “If I had known
about you, I don’t believe I’d have bought the place.
There was no necessity to foreclose, I am sure; but it
was just like Angie; and what must this Maude think of
me not to have answered her letter. I am so sorry;”
and his sorrow manifested itself in an increased attention
to the girl, over whom he adjusted his ulster more
carefully, for the air in the car was growing very damp
and chilly.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was broad daylight when Maude awoke, starting
up with a smile on her face and reminding Max of some
lovely child when first aroused from sleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, I have slept all night,” she exclaimed, as she
tossed back her wavy hair; “and you have given me
your shawl and ulster, too,” she added, with a blush
which made her face, as Max thought, the prettiest he
had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c012'>Who was she, he wondered, and once he thought to
ask her the question direct; then he tried by a little
<em>finessing</em> to find out who she was and where she came
from, but Maude’s mother had so strongly impressed it
upon her not to be at all communicative to strangers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>that she was wholly non-committal even while suspecting
his design, and when at last Canandaigua was
reached he knew no more of her history than when he
first saw her, white and trembling on the boat. She
was going to take the Genesee stage, she said, and expected
her uncle to meet her at Oak Corners in Richland.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, that is funny,” he said. “If it were not that
a carriage is to meet me, I should still be your fellow-traveler,
for my route lies that way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And then he did ask her uncle’s name. She surely
might tell him so much, Maude thought, and replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Captain James Alling, my mother’s brother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her name was not Alling, then, and reflecting that
now he knew who her uncle was he could probably
trace her, Max saw her into the stage, and taking her
ungloved hand in his held it perhaps a trifle longer than
he would have done if it had not been so very soft
and white and pretty, and rested so confidingly in his,
while she thanked him for his kindness. Then the
stage drove away, while he stood watching it, and wondering
why the morning was not quite so bright as it
had been an hour ago, and why he had not asked her
point-blank who she was, or had been so stupid as not
to give her his card.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Max Gordon, you certainly are getting into your
dotage,” he said to himself. “A man of your age to be
so interested in a little unknown girl! What would
Grace say? Poor Grace. I wonder if I shall find her
improved, and why she has buried herself in this part
of the country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As he entered the hotel a thought of Maude Graham’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>letter came to his mind, and calling for pen and paper he
dashed off the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Canandaigua</span>, September —, 18—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Miss Maude Graham</span>,—Your letter did not reach
me until last night, when it was brought me by a friend.
I have not been in Boston since the first of last July,
and the reason it was not forwarded to me is that you
addressed it wrong, and they were in doubt as to its
owner. My name is Gordon, not Marshall, as you supposed,
and I am very sorry for your sake and your
mother’s that I ever bought Spring Farm. Had I
known what I do now I should not have done so. But
it is too late, and I can only promise to keep it as you
wish until you can buy it back. You are a brave little
girl and I will sell it to you cheap. I should very much
like to know you, and when I am again in Merrivale I
shall call upon you and your mother, if she will let me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With kind regards to her I am</div>
      <div class='line in16'>Yours truly,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>“<span class='sc'>Max Gordon</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The letter finished, he folded and directed it to Miss
Maude Graham, Merrivale, Mass., while she for whom
it was intended was huddled up in one corner of the
crowded stage and going on as fast as four fleet horses
could take her towards Oak Corners and the friends
awaiting her there. Thus strangely do two lives sometimes
meet and cross each other and then drift widely
apart; but not forever, in this instance, let us hope.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>MISS RAYNOR.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>About a mile from Laurel Hill, a little village in
Richland, was an eminence, or plateau, from the top of
which one could see for miles the rich, well-cultivated
farms in which the town abounded, the wooded hills and
the deep gorges all slanting down to a common centre,
the pretty little lake, lying as in the bottom of a basin,
with its clear waters sparkling in the sunshine. And
here, just on the top of the plateau, where the view was
the finest, an eccentric old bachelor, Paul Raynor, had
a few years before our story opens, built himself a home
after his own peculiar ideas of architecture, but which,
when finished and furnished, was a most delightful
place, especially in the summer when the flowers and
shrubs, of which there was a great profusion, were in
blossom, and the wide lawn in front of the house was
like a piece of velvet. Here for two years Paul Raynor
had lived quite <i><span lang="fr">en prince</span></i>, and then, sickening with what
he knew to be a fatal disease, he had sent for his invalid
sister Grace, who came and stayed with him to the last,
finding after he was dead that all his property had been
left to her, with a request that she would make the
Cedars, as the place was called, her home for a portion
of the time at least. And so, though city bred and city
born, Grace had stayed on for nearly a year, leading a
lonely life, for she knew but few of her neighbors, while
her crippled condition prevented her from mingling at
all in the society she was so well fitted to adorn. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the reader will have guessed, Grace Raynor was the girl,
or rather woman, for she was over thirty now, to whom
Max Gordon had devoted the years of his early manhood,
in the vain hope that some time she would be
cured and become his wife. A few days before the one
appointed for her bridal she had been thrown from her
horse and had injured her spine so badly that for
months she suffered such agony that her beautiful hair
turned white; then the pain ceased suddenly, but left
her no power to move her lower limbs, and she had
never walked since and never would. But through all
the long years Max had clung to her with a devotion
born first of his intense love for her and later of his
sense of honor which would make him loyal to her even
to the grave. Knowing how domestic he was in his
tastes and how happy he would be with wife and children,
Grace had insisted that he should leave her and
seek some other love. But his answer was always the
same. “No, Grace, I am bound to you just as strongly
as if the clergyman had made us one, and will marry
you any day you will say the word. Your lameness is
nothing so long as your soul is left untouched, and your
face, too,” he would sometimes add, kissing fondly the
lovely face which, with each year, seemed to grow lovelier,
and from which the snowy hair did not in the least
detract.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Grace knew better than to inflict herself upon
him, and held fast to her resolve, even while her whole
being went out to him with an intense longing for his
constant love and companionship. Especially was this
the case at the Cedars, where she found herself very
lonely, notwithstanding the beauty of the place and its
situation.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“If he asks me again, shall I refuse?” she said to herself
on the September morning when Maude Graham
was alighting from the dusty stage at Oak Corners, two
miles away, and the carriage sent for Max was only an
hour behind.</p>

<p class='c012'>How pretty she was in the dainty white dress, with a
shawl of scarlet wool wrapped around her, as she sat in
her wheel chair on the broad piazza, which commanded
a view of the lake and the green hills beyond. Not
fresh and bright and glowing as Maude, who was like
an opening rose with the early dew upon it, but more
like a pale water lily just beginning to droop, though
very sweet and lovely still. There was a faint tinge of
color in her cheek as she leaned her head against the
cushions of her chair and wondered if she should find
Max the same ardent lover as ever, ready to take her to
his arms at any cost, or had he, during the past year,
seen some other face fairer and younger than her own.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall know in a moment if he is changed ever so
little,” she thought, and although she did not mean to
be selfish, and would at any moment have given him up
and made no sign, there was a throb of pain in her
heart as she tried to think what life would be without
Max to love her. “I should die,” she whispered, “and
please God, I shall die before many years and leave my
boy free.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was her boy still, just as young and handsome as
he had been thirteen years ago, when he lifted her so
tenderly from the ground and she felt his tears upon
her forehead as she writhed in her fearful pain. And
now when at last he came and put his arms around her
and took her face between his hands and looked fondly
into it as he questioned her of her health, she felt that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>he was unchanged, and thanked her Father for it. He
was delighted with everything, and sat by her until
after lunch, which was served on the piazza, and asked
her of her life there and the people in the neighborhood,
and finally if she knew of a Capt. Alling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Capt. Alling,” she replied; “why, yes. He lives
on a farm about two miles from here and we buy
our honey from him. A very respectable man, I think,
although I have no acquaintance with the family. Why
do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, nothing; only there was a girl on the train with
me who told me she was his niece,” Max answered indifferently,
with a vigorous puff at his cigar, which
Grace always insisted he should smoke in her presence.
“She was very pretty and very young. I should like to
see her again,” he added, more to himself than to Grace,
who, without knowing why, felt suddenly as if a cloud
had crept across her sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jealousy had no part in Grace’s nature, nor was she
jealous of this young, pretty girl whom Max would like
to see again, and to prove that she was not she asked
many questions about her and said she would try and
find out who she was, and that she presumed she had
come to attend the wadding of Capt. Alling’s daughter,
who was soon to be married. This seemed very probable,
and no more was said of Maude until the afternoon
of the day following, which was Sunday. Then, after
Max returned from church and they were seated at
dinner he said abruptly, “I saw her again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Saw whom?” Grace asked, and he replied, “My
little girl of the train. She was at church with her
uncle’s family. A rather ordinary lot I thought them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>but she looked as sweet as a June pink. You know
they are my favorite flowers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Grace answered slowly, while again a breath
of cold air seemed to blow over her and make her draw
her shawl more closely around her.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Max did not suspect it, and pared a peach for her
and helped her to grapes, and after dinner wheeled her
for an hour on the broad plateau, stooping over her
once and caressing her white hair, which he told her
was very becoming, and saying no more of the girl seen
in church that morning. The Allings had been late
and the rector was reading the first lesson when they
came in, father and mother and two healthy, buxom
girls, followed by Maude, who, in her black dress
looked taller and slimmer than he had thought her in
the car, and prettier, too, with the brilliant color on her
cheeks and the sparkle in the eyes which met his with
such glad surprise in them that he felt something stir in
his heart different from anything he had felt since he
and Grace were young. The Allings occupied a pew in
front of him and on the side, so that he could look at
and study Maude’s face, which he did far more than he
listened to the sermon. And she knew he was looking
at her, too, and always blushed when she met his earnest
gaze. As they were leaving the church he managed
to get near her, and said, “I hope you are quite well
after your long journey, Miss——.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Graham,” she answered, involuntarily, but so low
that he only caught the first syllable and thought that
she said <em>Grey</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was Miss Grey, then, and with this bit of information
he was obliged to be content. Twice during the
week he rode past the Alling house, hoping to see the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>eyes which had flashed so brightly upon him on the
porch of the church, and never dreaming of the hot tears
of homesickness they were weeping in the log school-house of the Bush district, where poor Maude was so
desolate and lonely. If he had, he might, perhaps,
have gone there and tried to comfort her, so greatly was
he interested in her, and so much was she in his mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>He stayed at the Cedars several days, and then finding
it a little tiresome said good-bye to Grace and went
his way again, leaving her with a vague consciousness
that something had come between them; a shadow
no larger than a man’s hand, it is true, but still a
shadow, and as she watched him going down the walk
she whispered sadly, “Max is slipping from me.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>THE SCHOOL MISTRESS.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The setting sun of a raw January afternoon was shining
into the dingy school-room where Maude sat by the
iron-rusted box stove, with her feet on the hearth, reading
a note which had been brought to her just before
the close of school by a man who had been to the postoffice
in the village at the foot of the lake. It was
nearly four months since she first crossed the threshold
of the log school-house, taking in at a glance the whole
dreariness of her surroundings, and feeling for the moment
that she could not endure it. But she was somewhat
accustomed to it now, and not half so much afraid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>of the tall girls and boys, her scholars, as she had been
at first, while the latter were wholly devoted to her and
not a little proud of their “young school ma’am,” as
they called her. Everybody was kind to her, and she
had not found “boarding round” so very dreadful after
all, for the fatted calf was always killed for her, and
the best dishes brought out, while it was seldom that
she was called upon to share her sleeping-room with
more than one member of the family. And still there
was ever present with her a longing for her mother and
for Johnnie and a life more congenial to her tastes.
Dreaming was out of the question now, and the book
which was to make her famous and buy back the old
home seemed very far in the future. Just how
large a portion of her thoughts was given to Max Gordon
it was difficult to say. She had felt a thrill of joy
when she saw him in church, and a little proud, too, it
may be, of his notice of her. Very minutely her
cousins had questioned her with regard to her acquaintance
with him, deploring her stupidity in not having
ascertained who he was. A relative, most likely, of
Miss Raynor, in whose pew he sat, they concluded, and
they told their cousin of the lady at the Cedars, Grace
Raynor, who could not walk a step, but was wheeled in
a chair, sometimes by a maid and sometimes by a man.
The lady <i><span lang="fr">par excellence</span></i> of the neighborhood she seemed
to be, and Maude found herself greatly interested in her
and in everything pertaining to her. Twice she had
been through the grounds, which were open to the public,
and had seen Grace both times in the distance, once
sitting in her chair upon the piazza, and once being
wheeled in the woods by her man-servant, Tom. But
beyond this she had not advanced, and nothing could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>farther from her thoughts than the idea that she would
ever be anything to the lady of the Cedars. Max Gordon’s
letter had been forwarded to her from Merrivale,
but had created no suspicion in her mind that he and
her friend of the train were one. She had thought it a
little strange that he should have been in Canandaigua
the very day that she arrived there, and wished she
might have seen him, but the truth never dawned upon
her until some time in December, when her mother
wrote to her that he had called to see them, expressing
much regret at Maude’s absence, and when told where
she was and when she went, exclaiming with energy,
as he sprang to his feet, “Why, madam, your daughter
was with me in the train,—a little blue-eyed, brown-haired
girl in black, who said she was Captain Alling’s
niece.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He seemed greatly excited,” Mrs. Graham wrote,
“and regretted that he did not know who you were.
He got an idea somehow that your name was <em>Grey</em>, and
said he received your letter with you asleep beside him.
He is a splendid looking man, with the pleasantest eyes
and the kindest voice I ever heard or saw.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ye-es,” Maude said slowly, as she recalled the voice
which had spoken so kindly to her, and the eyes which
had looked so pleasantly into her own. “And that was
Max Gordon! He was going to the Cedars, and Miss
Raynor is the girl for whom he has lived single all
these years. Oh-h!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was conscious of a vague regret that her stranger
friend was the betrothed husband of Grace Raynor,
who, at that very time, was thinking of her and fighting
down a feeling as near to jealousy as it was possible
for her to harbor. In the same mail with Maude’s letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>from her mother there had come to the Cedars one
from Max, who said that he had discovered who was
his <i><span lang="fr">compagnon da voyage</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is teaching somewhere in your town,” he wrote
“and I judge is not very happy there. Can’t you do
something for her, Grace? It has occurred to me that
to have a girl like her about you would do you a great
deal of good. We are both getting on in years, and
need something young to keep us from growing old, and
you might make her your companion. She is very
pretty, with a soft, cultivated voice, and must be a good
reader. Think of it, and if you decide to do it, inquire
for her at Captain Alling’s. Her name is Maude Graham.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours lovingly,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>“<span class='sc'>Max</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This was Max’s letter, which Grace read as she sat in
her cosy sitting-room with every luxury around her
which money could buy, from the hot house roses on the
stand beside her to the costly rug on which her chair
was standing in the ruddy glow of the cheerful grate
fire. And as she read it she felt again the cold breath
which had swept over her when Max was telling her of
the young girl who had interested him so much. And
in a way Grace, too, had interested herself in Maude,
and through her maid had ascertained who she was, and
that she was teaching in the southern part of the town.
And there her interest had ceased. But it revived
again on the receipt of Max’s letter and she said, “I
must see this girl first and know what she is like. A
woman can judge a woman better than a man, but I
wish Max had not said what he did about our growing
old. Am I greatly changed, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>She could manage her chair herself in the house, and
wheeling it before a long mirror, she leaned eagerly
forward and examined the face reflected there. A pale,
sweet face, framed in masses of snow white hair, which
rather added to its youthful appearance than detracted
from it, although she did not think so. She had been
so proud of her golden hair, and the bitterest tears she
had ever shed had been for the change in it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s my hair,” she whispered sadly,—“hair which
belongs to a woman of sixty, rather than thirty-three,
and there is a tired look about my eyes and mouth.
Yes, I am growing old, oh, Max——,” and the slender
fingers were pressed over the beautiful blue eyes
where the tears came so fast. “Yes, I’ll see the girl,”
she said, “and if I like her face, I’ll take her to please
him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She knew there was to be an illumination on Christmas
Eve in the church on Laurel Hill, and that Maude
Graham was to sing a Christmas anthem alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll go, and hear, and see,” she decided, and when the
evening came Grace was there in the Raynor pew listening
while Maude Graham sang, her bright face glowing
with excitement and her full, rich voice rising higher
and higher, clearer and clearer, until it filled the church
as it had never been filled before, and thrilled every
nerve of the woman watching her so intently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, she is pretty and good, too; I cannot be deceived
in that face,” she said to herself, and when,
after the services were over and Maude came up the
aisle past the pew where she was sitting, she put out
her hand and said, “Come here, my dear, and let me
thank you for the pleasure you have given me. You
have a wonderful voice and some time you must come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>and sing to me. I am Miss Raynor, and you are Maude
Graham.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was their introduction to each other, and that
night Maud dreamed of the lovely face which had
smiled upon her, and the voice, which had spoken so
kindly to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two weeks afterwards Grace’s note was brought to
her and she read it with her feet upon the stove hearth
and the low January sun shining in upon her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Raynor wanted her for a companion and friend,
to read and sing to and soothe her in the hours of languor
and depression, which were many.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am lonely,” she wrote, “and, as you know, wholly
incapacitated from mingling with the world, and I want
some one with me different from my maid. Will you
come to me, Miss Graham? I will try to make you
happy. If money is any object I will give you twice as
much as you are now receiving, whatever that may be.
Think of it and let me know your decision soon.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours very truly,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>“<span class='sc'>Grace Raynor</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Oh,” Maude cried. “Eight dollars a week and a
home at the Cedars, instead of four dollars a week and
boarding around. Of course I will go, though not till
my present engagement expires. This will not be until
some time in March,” and she began to wonder if she
could endure it so long, and, now that the pressure was
lifting, how she had ever borne it at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>But whatever may be the nature of our surroundings,
time passes quickly, and leaves behind a sense of nearly
as much pleasure as pain, and when at last the closing
day of school came, it was with genuine feelings of regret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>that Maude said good-bye to the pupils she had
learned to love and the patrons who had been so kind
to her.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='large'>AT THE CEDARS.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It had cost Grace a struggle before she decided to
take Maude as her companion, and she had been driven
past the little log house among the hills and through
the Bush district, that she might judge for herself of
the girl’s surroundings. The day was raw and blustering,
and great banks of snow were piled against the
fences and lay heaped up in the road unbroken save by
a foot path made by the children’s feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And it is through this she walks in the morning,
and then sits all day in that dingy room. I don’t believe
I should like it,” Grace thought, and that night
she wrote to Maude, offering her a situation with herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>And now, on a lovely morning in April, when the
crocuses and snowdrops were just beginning to blossom,
she sat waiting for her, wondering if she had
done well or ill for herself. She had seen Maude and
talked with her, for the latter had called at the Cedars
and spent an hour or more, and Grace had learned
much from her of her former life and of Spring Farm,
which she was going to buy back. Max’s name, however,
was not mentioned, although he was constantly
in the minds of both, and Grace was wondering if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>would come oftener to the Cedars if Maude were there.
She could not be jealous of the girl, and yet the idea
had taken possession of her that she was bringing her
to the Cedars for Max rather than for herself, and this
detracted a little from her pleasure when she began to
fit up the room her companion was to occupy. Such a
pretty room it was, just over her own, with a bow window
looking across the valley where the lake lay sleeping,
and on to the hills and the log school-house which,
had it been higher, might have been seen above the
woods which surrounded it. A room all pink and
white, with roses and lilies everywhere, and a bright
fire in the grate before which a willow chair was standing
and a Maltese kitten sleeping when Maude was ushered
into it by Jane, Miss Raynor’s maid.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, it is so lovely,” Maude thought, as she looked
about her, wondering if it were not a dream from which
she should presently awake.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it was no dream, and as the days went on it came
to be real to her, and she was conscious of a deep and
growing affection for the woman who was always so
kind to her and who treated her like an equal rather
than a hired companion. Together they read and
talked of the books which Maude liked best, and
gradually Grace learned of the dream life Maude had
led before coming to Richland, and of the people who
had deserted her among the hills, but who in this more
congenial atmosphere came trooping back, legions of
them, and crowding her brain until she had to tell of
them, and of the two lives she was living, the ideal and
the real. She was sitting on a stool at Grace’s feet,
with her face flushed with excitement as she talked of
the Kimbricks, and Websters, and Angeline Mason, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>were all with her now as they had been at home, and
all as real to her as Miss Raynor was herself. Laying
her hand upon the girl’s brown curls, Grace said, half
laughingly, “And so you are going to write a book.
Well, I believe all girls have some such aspiration. I
had it once, but it was swallowed up by a stronger,
deeper feeling, which absorbed my whole being.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here Grace’s voice trembled a little as she leaned
back in her chair and seemed to be thinking. Then,
rousing herself, she asked suddenly, “How old are
you, Maude?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nineteen this month,” was Maude’s reply, and
Grace went on: “Just my age when the great sorrow
came. That was fourteen years ago next June. I am
thirty-three, and Max is thirty-seven.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She said this last more to herself than to Maude, who
started slightly, for this was the first time his name had
been mentioned since she came to the Cedars.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a moment Grace continued: “I have never
spoken to you of Mr. Gordon, although I know you have
met him. You were with him on the train from Albany
to Canandaigua; he told me of you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He did!” Maude exclaimed, with a ring in her voice
which made Grace’s heart beat a little faster, but she
went calmly on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes; he was greatly interested in you, although he
did not then know who you were; but he knows now.
He is coming here soon. We have been engaged ever
since I was seventeen and he was twenty-one; fourteen
years ago the 20th of June we were to have been
married. Everything was ready; my bridal dress and
veil had been brought home, and I tried them on one
morning to see how I looked in them. I was beautiful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Max said, and I think he told the truth; for a woman
may certainly know whether the face she sees in the
mirror be pretty or not, and the picture I saw was very
fair, while he, who stood beside me, was splendid in his
young manhood. How I loved him; more, I fear, than
I loved God, and for that I was punished,—oh, so dreadfully
punished. We rode together that afternoon, Max
and I, and I was wondering if there were ever a girl as
happy as myself, and pitying the women I met because
they had no Max beside them, when suddenly my horse
reared, frightened by a dog, and I was thrown upon a
sharp curb-stone. Of the months of agony which
followed I cannot tell you, except that I prayed to die
and so be rid of pain. The injury was in my spine, and
I have never walked in all the fourteen years since.
Max has been true to me, and would have married me
had I allowed it. But I cannot burden him with a
cripple, and sometimes I wish, or think I do, that he
would find some one younger, fairer than I am, on whom
to lavish his love. He would make a wife so happy.
And yet it would be hard for me, I love him so much.
Oh, Max; I don’t believe he knows how dear he is to
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was crying softly now, and Maude was crying,
too; and as she smoothed the snow-white hair and
kissed the brow on which lines were beginning to show,
she said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“He will never find a sweeter face than yours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To her Max Gordon now was only the betrothed husband
of her mistress, and still she found herself looking
forward to his visit with a keen interest, wondering
what he would say to her, and if his eyes would kindle
at sight of her as they had done when she saw him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the church at Laurel Hill. He was to come on the
20th, the anniversary of the day which was to have been
his bridal day, and when the morning came, Grace said
to Maude:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d like to wear my wedding gown; do you think it
would be too much like Dickens’ Miss Havershaw?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes,” Maude answered, quickly, feeling that
faded satin and lace of fourteen years’ standing would
be sadly out of place. “You are lovely in those light
gowns you wear so much,” she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Grace wore the dress which Maude selected for
her; a soft, woolen fabric of a creamy tint, with a blue
shawl, the color of her eyes, thrown around her, and a
bunch of June pinks, Max’s favorite flowers, at her belt,
Then, when she was ready, Maude wheeled her out to
the piazza, where they waited for their visitor.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>MAX AT THE CEDARS.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The train was late that morning and lunch was nearly
ready before they saw the open carriage turn into the
grounds, with Max standing up in it and waving his hat
to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Maude,” Grace said, “I would give all I am
worth to go and meet him. Isn’t he handsome and
grand, my Max!” she continued, as if she would assert
her right to him and hold it against the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Maude did not hear her, for as Max alighted from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the carriage and came eagerly forward, she stole away,
feeling that it was not for her to witness the meeting of
the lovers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear Max, you are not changed, are you?” Grace
cried, extending her arms to him, with the effort to rise
which she involuntarily made so often, and which was
pitiful to see.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Changed, darling? How could I change in less
than a year?” Max answered, as he drew her face down
to his bosom and stroked her hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>Grace was not thinking of a physical change. Indeed
she did not know what she did mean, for she was not
herself conscious how strong an idea had taken possession
of her that she was losing Max. But with him
there beside her, her morbid fears vanished, and letting
her head rest upon his arm, she said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know, Max, only things come back to me to-day
and I am thinking of fourteen years ago and that I
am fourteen years older than I was then, and crippled
and helpless and faded, while you are young as ever.
Oh, Max, stay by me till the last. It will not be for
long. I am growing so tired and sad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Grace hardly knew what she was saying, or why, as
she said it, Maude Graham’s face, young and fair and
fresh, seemed to come between herself and Max, any
more than he could have told why he was so vaguely
wondering what had become of the girl in black, whom
he had seen in the distance quite as soon as he had seen
the woman in the chair. During his journey Grace and
Maude had been pretty equally in his mind, and he was
conscious of the feeling that the Cedars held an added
attraction for him because the latter was there; and
now, when he began to have a faint perception of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Grace’s meaning, though he did not associate it with
Maude, he felt half guilty because he had for a moment
thought any place where Grace was could be made
pleasanter than she could make it. Taking her face
between his hands he looked at it more closely, noticing
with a pang that it had grown thinner and paler and
that there were lines about the eyes and the mouth,
while the blue veins stood out full and distinct upon the
forehead. Was she slowly fading? he asked himself,
resolving that nothing should be lacking on his part to
prove that she was just as dear to him as in the days
when they were young and the future bright before
them. He did not even speak of Maude until he saw
her in the distance, trying to train a refractory honeysuckle
over a tall frame. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that Miss Graham, and do you like her as well as
ever?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, better and better every day,” was Grace’s reply.
“It was a little awkward at first to have a stranger
with me continually, but I am accustomed to her
now, and couldn’t part with her. She is very dear to
me,” she continued, while Max listened and watched
the girl, moving about so gracefully, and once showing
her arms to the elbows as her wide sleeves fell back in
her efforts to reach the top of the frame.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She oughtn’t to do that,” Grace said. “She is not
tall enough. Go and help her, Max,” and nothing loth,
Max went along the terrace to where Maude was standing,
her face flushed with exercise as she gave him her
hand and said, “Good-morning, Mr. Gordon. I am
Maude Graham. Perhaps you remember me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How could I forget you,” sprang to Max’s lips, but
he said instead, “Good-morning, Miss Graham. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>come to help you. Miss Raynor thinks it is bad for
your heart to reach so high.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Maude could have told him that her heart had not
beaten one half as fast while reaching up as it was
beating now, with him there beside her holding the vine
while she tied it to its place, his hand touching hers and
his arm once thrown out to keep her from falling as
she stumbled backward. It took a long time to fix that
honeysuckle, and Max had leisure to tell Maude of a
call made upon her mother only a week before.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Spring Farm is looking its loveliest, with the roses
and lilies in bloom,” he said, “and Angie, my sister, is
enjoying it immensely. She has filled the house with
her city friends and has made some changes, of which I
think you would approve. Your mother does, but
when she wanted to cut down that apple-tree in the
corner I would not let her do it. You remember it,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Mr. Gordon,” Maude exclaimed, “don’t let
her touch that tree. My play-house was under it, and
there the people used to come to see me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He did not know who the people were, for he had
never heard of Maude’s brain children,—the Kimbricks
and the Websters,—and could hardly have understood
if he had; but Maude’s voice was very pathetic and the
eyes which looked at him were full of tears, moving him
strangely and making him very earnest in his manner
as he assured her that every tree and shrub should be
kept intact for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know you are going to buy it back,” he continued
laughingly, as they walked slowly toward the
house where Grace was waiting to be taken in to lunch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and I shall do it, too. You will see; it may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>many years, but I trust you to keep it for me,” Maude
said, and he replied, “You may trust me with anything,
and I shall not disappoint you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The talk by the honeysuckle was one of many
which took place while Max was at the Cedars, for
Grace was too unselfish to keep him chained to her side,
and insisted that he should enjoy what there was to enjoy
in the way of rides and drives in the neighborhood,
and as she could not often go with him she sent Maude
in her stead, even though she knew the danger there
was in it, for she was not insensible to Max’s admiration
for the girl, or Maude’s interest in him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If Max is true to me to the last, and he will be, it is
all I ask,” she thought, and gave no sign of the ache in
her heart, when she saw him going from her with
Maude and felt that it was in more senses than one.
“If he is happy, I am happy, too, she would say to herself,
as she sat alone hour after hour, while Max and
Maude explored the country in every direction.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes they drove together, but oftener rode, for
Maude was a fine horsewoman and never looked better
than when on horseback, in the becoming habit which
Grace had given her and which fitted her admirably.
Together they went through the pleasant Richland
woods, where the grass was like a mossy carpet beneath
their horses’ hoofs, and the singing of the birds and the
brook was the only sound which broke the summer stillness,
then again they galloped over the hills and round
the lake, and once through the Bush district, up to the
little log house which Max expressed a wish to see. It
was past the hour for school. Teacher and scholars
had gone home, and tying their horses to the fence they
went into the dingy room and sat down side by side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>upon one of the wooden benches, and just where a ray
of sunlight fell upon Maude’s face and hair, for she had
removed her hat and was fanning herself with it. She
was very beautiful, with that halo around her head,
Max thought, as he sat watching and listening to her,
as in answer to his question, “How could you endure it
here?” she told him of her terrible homesickness during
the first weeks of her life as a school-teacher.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I longed so for mother and Johnnie,” she said, “and
was always thinking of them, and the dear old home,
and—and sometimes—of you, too, before I received
your letter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of me!” Max said, moving a little nearer to her,
while she went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I’ve wanted to tell you how angry I was because
you bought our home. I wrote you something
about it, you remember, but I did not tell you half how
bitter I felt. I know now you were not to blame, but I
did not think so then, and said some harsh things of you
to Archie; perhaps he told you. I said he might. Did
he?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” Max answered, playing idly with the riding
whip Maude held in her hand. “No, Archie has only
told me pleasant things of you. I think he is very fond
of you,” and he looked straight into Maude’s face, waiting
for her reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was surely nothing to him whether Archie were
fond of Maude, or she were fond of Archie, and yet her
answer was very reassuring and lifted from his heart a
little shadow resting there.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Maude said, without the slightest change in
voice or expression. “Archie and I are good friends.
I have known him and played with him, and quarreled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>with him ever since I was a child, so that he seems
more like a brother than anything else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, ye-es,” Max resumed, with a feeling of relief, as
he let his arm rest on the high desk behind her, so that
if she moved ever so little it would touch her.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was in Max’s mind no thought of love-making.
Indeed, he did not know that he was thinking of anything
except the lovely picture the young girl made
with the sunlight playing on her hair and the shy look
in her eyes as, in a pretty, apologetic way she told him
how she had disliked him and credited him with all the
trouble which had come upon them since her father’s
death.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, I thought I hated you,” she said with energy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hated me! Oh, Maude, you don’t hate me now, I
hope;—I could not bear that,” Max said, letting the whip
fall and taking Maude’s hand in his, as he said again,
“You don’t hate me now?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no; oh, no. I—oh, Mr. Gordon,” Maude began,
but stopped abruptly, startled by something in the eyes
of the man, who had never called her Maude before,
and whose voice had never sounded as it did now, making
every nerve thrill with a sudden joy, all the sweeter,
perhaps, because she knew it must not be.</p>

<p class='c012'>Wrenching her hand from his and springing to her
feet she said, “It is growing late, and Miss Raynor is
waiting for us. Have you forgotten <em>her</em>?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He had forgotten her for one delirious moment, but
she came back to him with a throb of pain and self-reproach
that he had allowed himself to swerve in the
slightest degree from his loyalty to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am not a man, but a traitor,” he said to himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>as he helped Maude into her saddle and then vaulted
into his own.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ride home was a comparatively silent one, for
both knew that they had not been quite true to the
woman who welcomed them back so sweetly and asked
so many questions about their ride and what they had
seen. Poor Grace; she did not in the least understand
why Maude lavished so much attention upon her that
evening, or why Max lingered longer than usual at her
side, or why his voice was so tender and loving, when
he at last said good-night and went to his own room,
and the self-castigation which he knew awaited him
there.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was a villain,” he said, as he recalled that little
episode in the school-house, when to have put his arm
around Maude Graham and held her for a moment,
would have been like heaven to him. “I was false to
Grace, although I did not mean it, and, God helping
me, I will never be so again.” Then, as he remembered
the expression of the eyes which had looked up
so shyly at him, he said aloud, “Could I win her, were
I free? But that is impossible. May God forgive me
for the thought. Oh, why has Grace thrown her so
much in my way? She surely is to blame for that,
while I——well, I am a fool, and a knave, and a
sneak.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He called himself a great many hard names that
night, and registered a vow that so long as Grace lived,
and he said he hoped she would live forever, he would
be true to her no matter how strong the temptation
placed in his way. It was a fierce battle Max fought, but
he came off conqueror, and the meeting between himself
and Maude next morning was as natural as if to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>neither of them had ever come a moment when they had
a glimpse of the happiness which, under other circumstances,
might perhaps have been theirs. Maude, too,
had had her hours of remorse and contrition and close
questioning as to the cause of the strange joy which
had thrilled every nerve when Max Gordon called her
Maude and asked her if she hated him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hate him! Never!” she thought; “but I have
been false to the truest, best woman that ever lived.
She trusted her lover to me, and——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not quite know what she had done, but whatever
it was it should not be repeated. There were to
be no more rides, or drives, or talks alone with Max.
And when next day Grace suggested that she go with
him to an adjoining town where a fair was to be held,
she took refuge in a headache and insisted that Grace
should go herself, while Max, too, encouraged it, and
tried to believe that he was just as happy with her beside
him as he would have been with the young girl
who brought a cushion for her mistress’ back and adjusted
her shawl about her shoulders and arranged her
bonnet strings, and then, kissing her fondly, said, “I
am so glad that you are going instead of myself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was for the benefit of Max, at whom she nodded
a little defiantly, and who understood her meaning as
well as if she had put it into words. Everything was
over between them, and he accepted the situation, and
during the remainder of his stay at the Cedars, devoted
himself to Grace with an assiduity worthy of the most
ardent lover. He even remained longer than he had
intended doing, for Grace was loth to let him go, and
the soft haze of early September was beginning to
show on the Richland hills when he at last said good-bye,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>promising to come again at Christmas, if it were
possible to do so.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>GOOD-BYE, MAX; GOOD-BYE.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was a cold, stormy afternoon in March. The
thermometer marked six below zero, and the snow
which had fallen the day before was tossed by the wind
in great white clouds, which sifted through every crevice
of the house at the Cedars, and beat against the window
from which Maude Graham was looking anxiously out
into the storm for the carriage which had been sent to
meet the train in which Max Gordon was expected. He
had not kept his promise to be with Grace at Christmas.
An important lawsuit had detained him, and as it would
be necessary for him to go to London immediately after
its close, he could not tell just when he would be at the
Cedars again.</p>

<p class='c012'>All through the autumn Grace had been failing, while
a cold, taken in November, had left her with a cough,
which clung to her persistently. Still she kept up,
looking forward to the holidays, when Max would be
with her. But when she found he was not coming she
lost all courage, and Maude was alarmed to see how
rapidly she failed. Nearly all the day she lay upon the
couch in her bedroom, while Maude read or sang to her
or talked with her of the book which had actually been
commenced, and in which Grace was almost as much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>interested as Maude herself. Grace was a careful and
discriminating critic, and if Maude were ever a success
she would owe much of it to the kind friend whose sympathy
and advice were so invaluable. A portion of
every day she wrote, and every evening read what she
had written, to Grace, who smiled as she recognized
Max Gordon in the hero and knew that Maude was
weaving the tale mostly from her own experience.
Even the Bush district and its people furnished material
for the plot, and more than one boy and girl who had
called Maude schoolma’am figured in its pages, while
Grace was everywhere, permeating the whole with her
sweetness and purity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall dedicate it to you,” Maude said to her one
day, and Grace replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“That will be kind; but I shall not be here to see it,
for before your book is published I shall be lying under
the flowers in Mt. Auburn. I want you to take me
there, if Max is not here to do it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Miss Raynor,” Maude cried, dropping her MS.
and sinking upon her knees beside the couch where
Grace was lying, “you must not talk that way. You
are not going to die. I can’t lose you, the dearest friend
I ever had. What should I do without you, and what
would Max Gordon do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>At the mention of Max’s name a faint smile played
around Grace’s white lips, and lifting her thin hand she
laid it caressingly upon the girl’s brown hair as she
said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Max will be sorry for awhile, but after a time there
will be a change, and I shall be only a memory. Tell
him I was willing, and that although it was hard at first
it was easy at the last.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>What did she mean? Maude asked herself, while her
thoughts went back to that summer afternoon in the log
school-house on the hill, when Max Gordon’s eyes and
voice had in them a tone and look born of more than
mere friendship. Did Grace know? Had she guessed
the truth? Maude wondered, as, conscience-stricken,
she laid her burning cheek against the pale one upon the
pillow. There was silence a moment, and when Grace
spoke again she said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is nearly time for Max to be starting for Europe,
or I should send for him to come, I wish so much to see
him once more before I die.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think a hundred trips to Europe would keep
him from you if he knew you wanted him?” Maude
asked, and Grace replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps not. I don’t know. I only wish he were
here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was the last of February, and after that Grace
failed so fast, that with the hope that it might reach
him before he sailed, Maude wrote to Max, telling him
to come at once, if he would see Grace before she died.
She knew about how long it would take her letter to
reach him and how long for him to come, allowing for
no delays, and on the morning of the first day when
she could by any chance expect him, she sent the carriage
to the Canandaigua station, and then all through
the hours of the long, dreary day, she sat by Grace’s
bedside, watching with a sinking heart the pallor on
her lips and brow, and the look she could not mistake
deepening on her face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What if she should die before he gets here, or what
if he should not come at all?” she thought, as the hours
went by.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>She was more afraid of the latter, and when she saw
the carriage coming up the avenue she strained her
eyes through the blinding snow to see if he were in it.
When he came before he had stood up and waved
his hat to them, but there was no token now to tell if
he were there, and she waited breathlessly until the
carriage stopped before the side entrance, knowing then
for sure that he had come.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank God!” she cried, as she went out to meet
him, bursting into tears as she said to him, “I am so
glad, and so will Miss Raynor be. She does not know
that I wrote you. I didn’t tell her, for fear you wouldn’t
come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She had given him her hand and he was holding it
fast as she led him into the hall. She did not ask him
when or where he received her letter. She only helped
him off with his coat, and made him sit down by the
fire while she told him how rapidly Grace had failed
and how little hope there was that she would ever
recover.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will help her, if anything can. I am going to
prepare her now,” she said, and, going out, she left him
there alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had been very sorry himself that he could not
keep his promise at Christmas, and had tried to find a
few days in which to visit the Cedars between the close
of the suit and his departure for England. But he
could not, and his passage was taken and his luggage
on the ship, which was to sail early in the morning,
when, about six o’clock in the evening, Maude’s letter
was brought to him, changing his plans at once. Grace
was dying,—the woman he had loved so long, and
although thousands of dollars depended upon his keeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>his appointment in London, he must lose it all, and
go to her. Sending for his luggage, and writing a few
letters of explanation, the next morning found him on
his way to the Cedars, which he reached on the day
when Maude expected him.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had left Grace asleep when she went to meet
Max, but on re-entering her room found her awake and
leaning on her elbow in the attitude of intense listening.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Maude,” she said, “was it a dream, or did I
hear Max speaking to you in the hall? Tell me is he
here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, he is here. I sent for him and he came,”
Maude replied, while Grace fell back upon her pillow,
whispering faintly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bring him at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come,” Maude said to Max, who followed her to
the sick-room, where she left him alone with Grace.</p>

<p class='c012'>He stayed by her all that night and the day following,
in order to give Maude the rest she needed, but when
the second night came they kept the watch together, he
on one side of the bed, and she upon the other, with
their eyes fixed upon the white, pinched face where the
shadow of death was settling. For several hours Grace
slept quietly. Then, just as the gray daylight was beginning
to show itself in the corners of the room, she
awoke and asked:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Max?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here, darling,” was his response, as he bent over
her and kissed her lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it has grown cold and dark, for I can’t see
you,” she said, groping for his hand, which she held
tightly between her own as she went on: “I have been
dreaming, Max,—such a pleasant dream, for I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>young again,—young as Maude, and wore my bridal
dress, just as I did that day when you said I was so
pretty. Do you remember it? That was years ago,—oh!
so many,—and I am getting old; we both are growing
old. You said so in your letter. But Maude is
young, and in my dream she wore the bridal dress at the
last, and I saw my own grave, with you beside it and
Maude, and both so sorry because I was dead. But it
is better so, and I am glad to die and be at rest. If I
could be what I once was, oh! how I should cling to
life! For I love you so much! Oh, Max, do you know,
can you guess how I have loved you all these years, and
what it has cost me to give you up?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Max’s only answer was the hot tears he dropped upon
her face as she went on: “You will not forget me,
that I know; but some time,—yes, some time,—and
when it comes, remember I was willing. I told Maude
so. Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here!” and Maude knelt, sobbing, by the dying
woman, who went on: “She has been everything to
me, Max, and I love her next to you. God bless you
both! And if, in the Heaven I am going to, I can
watch over you, I will do it, and be often, often with
you, when you think I’m far away. Who was it said
that? I read it long ago. But things are going from me,
and Heaven is very near, and the Saviour is with me,—closer,
nearer than you are, Max; and the other world
is just in sight, where I soon shall be, free from pain,
with my poor, crippled feet all strong and well, like
Maude’s. Dear Maude! tell her how I loved her; tell
her——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here her voice grew indistinct, and for a few moments
she seemed to be sleeping; then, suddenly, opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>her eyes wide, she exclaimed, as an expression of joy
broke over her face: “It is here,—the glory which
shineth as the noonday. In another moment I shall be
walking the golden streets. Good-bye, Max; good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Grace was dead, and Maude made her ready for the
coffin, her tears falling like rain upon the shrivelled feet
and on the waxen hands which she folded over the pulseless
bosom, placing in them the flowers her mistress had
loved best in life. She was to be buried in Mt. Auburn,
and Maude went with the remains to Boston, as Grace
had requested her to do, caring nothing because Mrs.
Marshall-More hinted broadly at the impropriety of the
act, wondering how she could have done it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She did it at Grace’s request, and to please me,”
Max said; and that silenced the lady, who was afraid of
her brother, and a little afraid of Maude, who did
not seem quite the girl she had last seen in Merrivale.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What will you do now? Go back to your teaching?”
she asked, after the funeral was over.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall go home to mother,” Maude replied, and
that afternoon she took the train for Merrivale, accompanied
by Max, who was going on to New York, and
thence to keep his appointment in London.</p>

<p class='c012'>Few were the words spoken between them during the
journey, and those mostly of the dead woman lying
under the snow at Mt. Auburn; but when Merrivale
was reached, Max took the girl’s hands and pressed
them hard as he called her a second time by her name.</p>

<p class='c012'>“God bless you, Maude, for all you were to Grace.
When I can I will write to you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Only for a moment the train stopped at the station,
and then it moved swiftly on, leaving Maude standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>upon the platform with her mother and John, while
Max resumed his seat, and pulling his hat over his eyes,
never spoke again until New York was reached. A
week later and a ship of the Cunard line was plowing
the ocean to the eastward, and Max Gordon was among
the passengers, silent and abstracted, with a bitter
sense of loneliness and pain in his heart as he thought
of the living and the dead he was leaving behind,—Grace,
who was to have been his bride, dead in all her
sweetness and beauty, and Maude, who was nothing to
him but a delicious memory, alive in all her freshness
and youthful bloom. He could hardly tell of which he
thought the more, Grace or Maude. Both seemed ever
present with him, and it was many a day before he
could rid himself of the fancy that two faces were close
against his own, one cold and dead, as he had seen it
last, with the snowy hair about the brow and a smile of
perfect peace upon the lips which had never said aught
but words of love to him,—the other glowing with life
and girlish beauty, as it had looked at him in the gathering
darkness when he stood upon the car step and
waved it his good-bye.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>AT LAST.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Five years had passed since Grace was laid in her
grave in Mt. Auburn, and Max was still abroad, leading
that kind of Bohemian life which many Americans
lead in Europe, when there is nothing to call them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>home. And to himself Max often said there was nothing
to call him home, but as often as he said it a throb
of pain belied his words, for he knew that across the
sea was a face and voice he was longing to see and
hear again, a face which now visited him in his dreams
quite as often as that of his dead love, and which he
always saw as it had looked at him that summer afternoon
in the log house among the Richland hills, with
the sunlight falling upon the rings of hair, and lending
a warmer tint to the glowing cheeks. Delicious as was
the memory of that afternoon, it had been the means of
keeping Max abroad during all these years, for, in the
morbid state of mind into which he had fallen after
Grace’s death, he felt that he must do penance for having
allowed himself for a moment to forget her, who
had believed in him so fully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Grace trusted me, and I was false to her and will
punish myself for it, even if by the means I lose all that
now makes life seem desirable,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so he stayed on and on, year after year, knowing
always just where Maude was and what she was doing,
for Archie kept him informed. Occasionally he wrote
to her himself,—pleasant, chatty letters, which had in
them a great deal of Grace,—his lost darling, he called
her,—and a little of the places he was visiting. Occasionally,
too, Maude wrote to him, her letters full of
Grace, with a little of her life in Merrivale, for she was
with her mother now, and had been since Miss Raynor’s
death. A codicil to Grace’s will, bequeathing her a few
thousand dollars, made it unnecessary for her to earn
her own livelihood. Indeed, she might have bought
Spring Farm, if she had liked; but this she would not
do. The money given for that must be earned by herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>paid by the book she was writing, and which, after
it was finished and published, and after a few savage
criticisms by some dyspeptic critics, who saw no good
in it, began to be read, then to be talked about, then to
sell,—until finally it became the rage and was found in
every book store, and railway car, and on almost every
parlor table in New England, while the young authoress
was spoken of as “a star which at one flight had soared
to the zenith of literary fame,” and this from the very
pens which at first had denounced “Sunny Bank” as a
milk-and-watery effort, not worth the paper on which it
was written.</p>

<p class='c012'>All Mrs. Marshall-More’s guests at Spring Farm read
it, and Mrs. Marshall-More and Archie read it, too, and
both went down to congratulate the author upon her
success, the latter saying to her, when they were alone:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say, Maude, your prophecy came true. You told
me you’d write a book which every one would read, and
which would make mother proud to say she knew you,
and, by Jove, you have done it. You ought to hear her
talk to some of the Boston people about Miss Graham,
the authoress. You’d suppose you’d been her dearest
friend. I wonder what Uncle Max will say? I told
you you would make him your hero, and you have. I
recognized him at once; but the heroine is more like
Grace than you. I am going to send it to him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And the next steamer which sailed from New York
for Europe carried with it Maude’s book, directed to
Max Gordon, who read it at one sitting in a sunny nook
of the Colosseum, where he spent a great part of his
time. Grace was in it, and he was in it, too, he was
sure, and, reading between the lines what a stranger
could not read, he felt when he had finished it that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the passionate love of the heroine for the hero he heard
Maude calling to him to come back to the happiness
there was still for him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I will go,” he said. “Five years of penance
have atoned for five minutes of forgetfulness, and Grace
would bid me go, if she could, for she foresaw what
would be, and told me she was willing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With Max to will was to do, and among the list of
passengers who sailed from Liverpool, March 20th,
18—, was the name of Maxwell Gordon, Boston, Mass.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c012'>It was the 2d of April, and a lovely morning, with
skies as blue and air as soft and warm as in the later
days of May. Spring Farm, for the season, was looking
its loveliest, for Mrs. Marshall-More had lavished fabulous
sums of money upon it, until she had very nearly
transformed it into what she meant it should be, an English
Park. She knew that Maude had once expressed
her intention to buy it back some day, but this she was
sure she could never do, and if she could Max would
never sell it, and if he would she would never let him.
So, with all these <em>nevers</em> to reassure her, she went on
year after year improving and beautifying the place until
it was worth far more than when it came into her hands,
and she was contemplating still greater improvements
during the coming summer, when Max suddenly walked
in upon her, and announced his intention of going to
Merrivale the next day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But where will you stay? Both houses are closed
only the one at Spring Farm has in it an old couple—Mr.
and Mrs. Martin—who look after it in the winter,”
she said, and Max replied:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“I will stay at Spring Farm with the Martins. I
want to see the place.” And the next day found him
there, occupying the room which, by a little skillful
questioning of Mrs. Martin, he learned had been Maude’s
when her father owned the farm.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Graham was home, she said, and at once launched
out into praises of the young authoress of whom Merrivale
was so proud.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And to think,” she said, “that she was born here in
this very house! It seems so queer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And is the house more honored now than when she
was simple Maude Graham?” Max asked, and the old
lady replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“To be sure it is. Any house can have a baby born
in it, but not every one an authoress!” and with that
she bustled off to see about supper for her guest.</p>

<p class='c012'>Max was up early the next morning, wondering how
soon it would be proper for him to call upon Maude.
He had no thought that she would come to him, and
was somewhat surprised when just after breakfast her
card was brought up by Mrs. Martin, who said she was
in the parlor. Maude had heard of his arrival from Mr.
Martin, who had stopped at the cottage the previous
night on his way to the village.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Gordon in town! I supposed he was in
Europe!” she exclaimed, feeling herself grow hot and
cold and faint as she thought of Max Gordon being so
near to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>That very afternoon she had received the first
check from her publisher, and been delighted with the
amount, so much more than she had expected. There
was enough to buy Spring Farm, if Max did not ask too
much, and she resolved to write to him at once and ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>his price. But that was not necessary now, for he was
here and she should see him face to face, and the next
morning she started for Spring Farm immediately after
their breakfast, which was never served very early.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will he find me greatly changed, I wonder,” she
thought, as she sat waiting for him, her heart beating so
rapidly that she could scarcely speak when at last he
came and stood before her, the same man she had
parted from five years before save that he seemed a little
older, with a look of weariness in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>But that lifted the moment they rested upon her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Maude,” was all he could say, as he looked into
the face he had seen so often in his dreams, though
never as beautiful as it was now. “Maude,” he began
at last, “I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you
again, or how glad I am for your success. I read the
book in Rome. Archie sent it to me, and I have come
to congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was talking so fast and pressing her hands so hard
that he almost took her breath away. But she released
herself from him, and, determining to have the <em>business</em>
off her mind as soon as possible, began abruptly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was surprised to hear of your arrival, and glad,
too, as it saves me the trouble of writing you. I can
buy Spring Farm now. You know you promised to
keep it for me. What is your price?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How much can you give?” Max asked; and without
stopping to consider the strangeness of the question,
Maude told him frankly the size of the check she had
received, and asked if it were enough.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Maude,” Max said, and over the face looking so
anxiously at him there fell a cloud of disappointment as
Maude replied:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“Is it much more you ask?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, a great deal more,” and Max seated himself
beside her upon the sofa, for she was now sitting down;
“but I think you can arrange it. Don’t look so sorry;
It is <em>you</em> I want, not your money. Will you give me
yourself in return for Spring Farm?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He had her hands again, but she drew them from
him, and covering her face with them, began to cry,
while he went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Five years is a long time to wait for one we love,
and I have waited that length of time, with thoughts of
you in my heart, almost as much as thoughts of Grace,
whom I loved dearly while she lived. But she is dead,
and could she speak she would bid you grant me the
happiness I have been denied so many years. I think
she knew it would come some day. I am sure she did,
and she told me she was willing. I did not mean to ask
you quite so soon, but the sight of you, and the
belief that you care for me as I care for you, has made
me forget all the proprieties, and I cannot recall my
words, so I ask you again to be my wife, to give me
yourself as the price of Spring Farm, which shall be
your home as long as you choose to make it so. Will
you, Maude? I have come thousands of miles for your
answer, which must not be no.”</p>

<p class='c012'>What else he said, or what she said, it is not necessary
for the reader to know; only this, that when the two
walked back to the cottage Maude said to her mother,
“I am to marry Mr. Gordon in June, and you will spend
the summer in our old home, and John will go to college
in the fall.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was very bad taste in Max to select the 20th of
June for his wedding day, and she should suppose he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>would remember twenty years ago, when Grace Raynor
was to have been his bride, Mrs. Marshall-More said to
Archie, when commenting upon her brother’s approaching
marriage, which did not altogether please her. She
would far rather that he should remain single, for
Archie’s sake and her own. And still it was some comfort
that she was to have for her sister one so famous as
Maude was getting to be. So she went up to Merrivale
early in June and opened her own house, and patronized
Maude and Mrs. Graham, and made many suggestions
with regard to the wedding, which she would have had
very fine and elaborate had they allowed it. But
Maude’s preference was for a quiet affair, with only a
few of her more intimate friends present. And she had
her way. Archie was there, of course, and made himself
master of ceremonies. He had received the news of
Maude’s engagement with a keener pang of regret than
he had thought it possible for him to feel, and suddenly
woke up to a consciousness that he had always had a
greater liking for Maude than he supposed. But it was
too late now, and casting his regrets to the winds he
made the best of it, and was apparently the gayest of
all the guests who, on the morning of the 20th of June,
assembled in Mrs. Graham’s parlor, where Max and
Maude were made one.</p>

<p class='c012'>Aunt Maude, Archie called her, as he kissed her and
asked if she remembered the time she cried on the neck
of the brown ox, and declared her hatred of Max and all
his relations.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I did not know him then; did I, Max?” Maude
said; and the bright face she lifted to her husband told
that she was far from hating him now.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a short trip to the West and a flying visit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>to Richland and the Cedars, so fraught with memories
of the past and of Grace, whose grave on the wedding
day had been one mass of flowers which Max had
ordered put there. “Her wedding garment,” he said
to Maude, to whom he told what he had done. “She
seems very near to me now, and I am sure she is glad.”</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c012'>It was a lovely July day, when Max and Maude returned
from their bridal journey and took possession of
the old home at Spring Farm, where Mrs. Graham met
them with a very different expression upon her face
from what it wore when we first saw her there years
ago. The place was hers again, to enjoy as long as she
lived; and if it had been beautiful when she left it, she
found it far more so now, for Mrs. Marshall-More’s improvements,
for which Max’s money had paid, were
mostly in good taste, and never had the grounds looked
better than when Max and Maude drove into them on
this July afternoon. Although a little past their prime,
there were roses everywhere, and the grassy walks,
which Mrs. More had substituted in place of gravel,
were freshly cut, and smooth and soft as velvet, while
the old-fashioned flowers Maude loved so well, were filling
the air with their perfume, and the birds in the
maple tree seemed carolling a welcome to the bride
so full were they of song.</p>

<p class='c012'>And here we shall leave her, happy in her old home
and in her husband’s love, which is more to her than all
the world beside. Whether she will ever write another
book we do not know, probably she will, for where the
brain seeds have taken root it is hard to dislodge them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>and Maude often hears around her the voices of new
ideal friends, to whom she may some time be compelled
to give shape and name, as she did to the friends of her
childhood.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE HEPBURN LINE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER I.—<span class='sc'>Doris’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>MY AUNTS.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>I had come from my mother’s burial to the rector’s
house, where I was to stay until it should be known
what disposition would be made of me by my father’s
aunts, the Misses Morton, who lived at Morton Park,
near Versailles, Kentucky. Of these aunts I knew
little, except that there were three of them now, but
there had been four, and my great-grandfather, an eccentric
old man, had called them respectively, Keziah,
Desire, Maria and Beriah which odd names he had
shortened into Kizzy and Dizzy, Rier and Brier. My
father, who had lived with them when a boy, had often
talked of Morton Park, and once when he was telling
me of the grand old house, with its wide piazza and
Corinthian pillars, its handsome grounds and the troop
of blacks ready to come at his call, I had asked him
why he didn’t go back there, saying I should like it
better than our small cottage, where there were no
grounds and no Corinthian pillars and no blacks to wait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>upon us. For a moment he did not answer, but glanced
at my mother with a look of unutterable tenderness,
then, drawing us both closely to him, he said, “If I go
there I must leave you behind; and I would rather
have mamma and you than all the blacks and Corinthian
pillars in the world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Although very young, I felt intuitively that Morton
Park was not a pleasant topic of conversation, and I
rarely spoke of it to him after that, but I often thought
of it, with its Corinthian pillars for which I had a great
reverence, and of the blacks, and the maple-trees, and
the solid silver from which my aunts dined every day,
and wondered when they were so rich why we were so
poor and why my father worked as hard as I knew he
did, for he often lay upon the couch, saying he was
tired, and looking very pale about his mouth, with a
bright red spot on either cheek. I heard some one call
these spots “the hectic,” but did not know what this
meant until later on, when he stayed in bed all the time
and the doctor said he was dying with quick consumption.
Then there came a day when I was called from
school and hurried home to find him dead,—my handsome
young father, who had always been so loving to
me, and whose last words were, “Tell little Doris to be
a good girl and kind to her mother. God bless her!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The blow was so sudden that for a time my mother
seemed stunned and incapable of action, but she was
roused at last by a letter from my Aunt Keziah, to whom
she had written after my father’s death. I say a letter,
but it was only an envelope containing a check for a
hundred dollars and a slip of paper with the words,
“For Gerold’s child,” and when my mother saw it there
was a look on her face which I had never seen before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>and I think her first impulse was to tear up the check,
but, reflecting that it was not hers to destroy, she only
burned the paper and put the money in the bank for
me, and then went bravely to work to earn her living
and mine, sometimes taking boarders, sometimes going
out to nurse sick people, and at last doing dressmaking
at home and succeeding so well that I never knew what
real poverty was, and was as happy and free from care
as children usually are.</p>

<p class='c012'>My father had been an artist, painting landscapes and
portraits when he could find sale for them, and, when
he could not, painting houses, barns and fences, for
although he had been reared in the midst of luxury, and,
as I now know, belonged to one of the best families in
Kentucky, he held that all kinds of labor, if necessary,
were honorable, and was not ashamed to stand in his
overalls side by side with men who in birth and education
were greatly his inferiors. At the time of his
death he had in his studio a few pictures which had not
been sold. Among them was a small one of the house
in Morton Park, with its huge white pillars and tall trees
in front, and one or two negroes playing under the
trees. This I claimed for my own, and also another,
which was a picture of his four aunts taken in a group
in what seemed to be a summer-house. “The Quartette,”
he called it, and I had watched him with a great
deal of interest as he brought into seeming real life the
four faces so unlike each other, Aunt Kizzy, stern and
severe and prim, with a cap on her head after the English
style, which she affected because her grandfather
was English,—Aunt Dizzy, who was very pretty and
very youthfully dressed, with flowers in her hair,—Aunt
Rier, a gentle, matronly woman, with a fat baby in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>lap which I did not think particularly good-looking,—and
Aunt Brier, with a sweet face like a Madonna and
a far-away look in her soft gray eyes which reminded
one of Evangeline. Behind the four was my father,
leaning over Aunt Rier and holding a rose before the
baby, who was trying to reach it. The picture fascinated
me greatly, and when I heard it was to be sold,
with whatever other effects there were in the studio, I
begged to keep it. But my mother said No, with the
same look on her face which I had seen when she
burned Aunt Kizzy’s letter. And so it was sold to a
gentleman from Boston, who was spending the summer
in Meadowbrook, and I thought no more of it until years
after, when it was brought to my mind in a most unexpected
manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was ten when I lost my father, and fourteen when
my mother, too, died suddenly, and I was alone, with no
home except the one the rector kindly offered me until
something should be heard from my aunts. My mother
had seemed so well and active, and, with her brilliant
color and beautiful blue eyes and chestnut hair which
lay in soft waves all over her head, had been so pretty
and young and girlish-looking, that it was hard to believe
her dead, and the hearts of few girls of fourteen
have ever been wrung with such anguish as I felt when,
after her funeral, I lay down upon a bed in the rectory
and sobbed myself into a disturbed sleep, from which I
was roused by the sound of voices in the adjoining room,
where a neighbor was talking with Mrs. Wilmot, the
rector’s wife, of me and my future.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Her aunts will have to do something now. They
will be ashamed not to. Do you know why they have
so persistently ignored Mr. and Mrs. Gerold Morton?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>It was Mrs. Smith, the neighbor, who asked the question,
and Mrs. Wilmot replied, “I know but little, as
Mrs. Morton was very reticent upon the subject. I
think, however, that the aunts were angry because
Gerold, who had always lived with them, made what
they thought a misalliance by marrying the daughter
of the woman with whom he boarded when in college.
They had in mind another match for him, and when he
disappointed them, they refused to recognize his wife
or to see him again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But did he have nothing from his father? I thought
the Mortons were very rich,” Mrs. Smith said, and Mrs.
Wilmot answered her, “Nothing at all, for his father,
too, had married against the wishes of <em>his</em> father, a very
hard and strange man, I imagine, who promptly disinherited
his son. But when the young wife died at the
birth of her child, the aunts took the little boy Gerold
and brought him up as their own. I do not at all understand
it, but I believe the Morton estate is held by a
long lease and will eventually pass from the family
unless some one of them marries somebody in the family
of the old man who gave the lease.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They seem to be given to misalliances,” Mrs. Smith
rejoined; “but if they could have seen Gerold’s wife
they must have loved her, she was so sweet and pretty.
Doris is like her. She will be a beautiful woman, and
her face alone should commend her to her aunts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>No girl of fourteen can hear unmoved that she is
lovely, and, although I was hot with indignation at my
aunts for their treatment of my father and their contempt
for my mother, I was conscious of a stir of gratification,
and as I went to the washstand to bathe my
burning forehead I glanced at myself in the mirror.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>My face was swollen with weeping, and my eyes were
very red, with dark circles around them, but they were
like my mother’s, and my hair was like hers, too, and
there was an expression about my mouth which brought
her back to me. I was like my mother, and I was glad
she had left me her heritage of beauty, although I cared
but little whether it commended me to my aunts or
not, as I meant to keep aloof from them, if possible. I
could take care of myself, I thought, and any hardship
would be preferable to living with them, even should
they wish to have me do so, which was doubtful.</p>

<p class='c012'>To Mrs. Wilmot I said nothing of what I had overheard,
but waited in some anxiety for Aunt Kizzy’s
letter, which came about two weeks after my mother’s
death. It was directed to Mr. Wilmot, and was as
follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Morton Park</span>, September 10, 18—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Rev. J. S. Wilmot</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—Your letter is received, and I have delayed
my reply until we could give our careful consideration
as to what to do, or rather how to do it. We
have, of course, no option in the matter as to <em>what</em> to
do, for naturally we must care for Gerold’s daughter,
but we shall do it in the way most agreeable to ourselves.
As you will have inferred, we are all elderly people,
and I am old. I shall be sixty next January. Miss
Desire, my sister, is forty-seven. (Between her and myself
there were two boys who died in infancy.) Maria,
my second sister, would, if living, be forty-five, and
Beriah is nearly thirty-eight. Thus, you see, we are no
longer young, but are just quiet people, with our habits
too firmly fixed to have them broken in upon by a girl
who probably talks slang and would fill the house with
noise and chatter, singing at most inopportune moments,
banging the doors, pulling the books from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>shelves and the chairs into the middle of the rooms, and
upsetting things generally. No, we couldn’t bear it,
and just the thought of it has given me a chill.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We expect to educate the girl,—Doris, I think you
called her,—but it must be at the North. If there is a
good school in Meadowbrook, perhaps it will be well
for her to remain there for a while, and if you choose to
retain her in your family you will be suitably remunerated
for all the expense and trouble. When she is
older I shall place her in some institution where she
will receive a thorough education, besides learning the
customs of good society. After that we may bring her
to Morton Park. For the present, however, I prefer
that she should remain with you, for, as you are a
clergyman, you will attend to her moral training and
see that she is staunch and true in every respect. I hate
deception of all kinds, and I wish her to learn the
Lord’s Prayer and the Ten Commandments and the
Creed, and to be confirmed at the proper age. She is
about ten now, is she not?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Enclosed you will find a check sufficient, I think, for
the present necessities. If more is needed, it will be
sent. Please let me know if there is a good school in
Meadowbrook, and if there is none, will you kindly recommend
one which you think suitable?</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours truly,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>“<span class='sc'>Miss Keziah Morton</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This was the letter which I read, looking over Mr.
Wilmot’s shoulder, and growing more and more angry
as I read, it was so heartless and cold, with no word of
real interest or sympathy for me, who was merely a
burden which must be carried, whether she were willing
or not.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll never accept a penny from her,” I exclaimed,
“and you may tell her so. I’d rather scrub than be
dependent upon these proud relatives, who evidently
think me a heathen. The Lords Prayer, indeed! and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>I fourteen years old! I wonder if she thinks I know
how to read!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was very defiant and determined, but after a little I
grew calmer, and as the graded school in Meadowbrook,
which I had always attended, was excellent of its kind,
and the Wilmots were glad to have me with them, I
consented at last that a letter to that effect should be
forwarded to Kentucky. But when Mr. Wilmot suggested
that I, too, should write and thank my aunt for
her kindness, I stoutly refused. I was not thankful, I
said, neither did I think her kind as I understood kindness,
and I could not tell a lie. Later, however, it
occurred to me that as she had said she wished me to be
true and staunch, and that she hated deception, it might
be well to let her know just how I felt towards her, so
as not to occupy a false position in the future. Accordingly
I wrote a letter, of which the following is a copy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Meadowbrook, Mass.</span>, September—, 18—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Miss Keziah Morton</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Madam</span>,—Mr. Wilmot has told you that there
is a good school in Meadowbrook and that he is glad to
keep me in his family. He wished me also to thank you
for your kindness in furnishing the means for my education,
and if I really felt thankful I would do so. But I
don’t, and I cannot pretend to be grateful, for I do not
think your offer was made in kindness, but because, as
you said in your letter, you had no option except to
care for me. You said, too, that you did not like deception
of any kind, and I think I’d better tell you how I
feel about accepting help from you. Since my mother
died I have accidentally heard how you treated her and
neglected my father because of her, and naturally I am
indignant, for a sweeter, lovelier woman than my
mother never lived. When she died and left me alone,
there was a leaning in my heart towards you and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>other aunts, because you were the only relatives I have
in the world, and if you had shown the least sympathy
for me I could have loved you so much. But in your
letter you never said one word of pity or comfort. You
offered to educate me, that was all. But I prefer to
care for myself, and I can do it, too. I am fourteen,
and can earn my own living. I can make dresses, as
mother did after father died, or I can do second work
until I have enough to pay for my schooling. And I
would rather do it than be indebted to any one, and if,
when you get this, you think best to change your mind,
I shall be glad. But if you do not, I shall try to
improve every moment and get a thorough education as
soon as possible, and when I can I shall pay you every
dollar you expend for me, and you need have no fears
that I shall ever disgrace my father’s name, or you
either.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I used to think that I should like to see Morton
Park, as it was once my father’s home, but since reading
your letter I have no desire to go there and bang
doors, and pull the books from the shelves, and sing,
whether invited to or not, and shock you with slang. I
suppose I do use some,—all the girls do, and example is
contagious,—and I am fond of singing, and would like
nothing better than to take lessons in vocal and instrumental
music, but I am not quite a heathen, and can
hardly remember when I did not know the Lord’s
Prayer, and Ten Commandments, and Creed. But I
have not been confirmed, and do not intend to be until
I am a great deal better than I am now, for I believe
there is something necessary to confirmation besides
mere intellectual knowledge. Father and mother
taught me that, and they were true Christians.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Father used sometimes to tell me of his home and
his aunts, who were kind to him, and so, perhaps, you
would like to know how peacefully he died, and how
handsome he was in his coffin, just as if he were asleep.
But mother was lovelier still, with such a sweet smile on
her face, and her dear little hands folded upon her
bosom. There were needle-pricks and marks of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>hard work she had done on her fingers, but I covered
them with great bunches of the white pond-lilies she
loved so much, and then kissed her good-bye forever,
with a feeling that my heart was broken; and, oh, it
aches so now when I remember that in all the world
there is no one who cares for me, or on whom I have
any claim.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know why I have written this to you, who,
of course, have no interest in it, but guess I did it
because I am sure you once loved father a little. I do
not expect you to love me, but if I can ever be of any
service to you I will, for father’s sake; and something
tells me that in the future, I don’t know when or how, I
shall bring you some good. Until then adieu.</p>

<p class='c012'>I knew this was not the kind of letter which a girl of
fourteen should send to a woman of sixty, but I was
indignant and hot-headed and young, and felt that in
some way I was avenging my mother’s wrongs, and so
the letter was sent, unknown to the Wilmots, and I
waited anxiously for the result. But there was none, so
far as I knew. Aunt Kizzy did not answer it, and in
her letter to Mr. Wilmot she made no reference to it.
She merely said she was glad I was to live in a clergyman’s
family under religious influence, and added that
if I had a good voice and he thought it desirable I was
to have instruction in both vocal and instrumental
music.</p>

<p class='c012'>It did not occur to me to connect this with anything
I had written, but I was very glad, for I was passionately
fond of music, as I was of books generally. And
so for two years I was a pupil in the High School in
Meadowbrook, passing from one grade to another, until
at last I was graduated with all the honors which such
an institution could give.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>During this time not a word had ever been written to
me by my aunts. The bills had been regularly paid
through Mr. Wilmot, to whom Aunt Kizzy’s letters
were addressed, and at the end of every quarter a report
of my standing in scholarship and deportment had been
forwarded to Kentucky. And that was all I knew of
my relatives, who might have been Kamschatkans for
anything they were to me.</p>

<p class='c012'>About six months before I was graduated, Mr. Wilmot
was told that I was to be sent to Madame De
Moisiere’s School in Boston, and then, three months
later, without any reason for the change, I learned that
I was to go to Wellesley, provided I could pass the necessary
examination. Of this I had no fears, but the
change disappointed me greatly, as I had heard glowing
accounts of Madame De Moisiere’s School from a girl
friend who had been there, and at first I rebelled against
Wellesley, which I fancied meant nothing but hard
study, with little recreation. But there was no help for
it. Aunt Keziah’s law was the law of the Medes and
Persians, and one morning in September I said good-bye
to Meadowbrook and started for Wellesley, which
seemed to me then a kind of intellectual prison.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ten o’clock at night, and I have brought out my old
book for a little chat. I am sure I don’t know why I
continue to write in my journal, when I am nearly
forty years old, unless it is because I began it nineteen
years ago, on the day after I said good-bye to Tom
forever and felt that my heart was broken. It was

under the elms in the Park and he told me I was a
coward, because I would not brave Kizzy’s wrath and
marry out of the “accursed Hepburn line,” as he called
it. Well, I <em>was</em> afraid of Kizzy, and shrank from all
the bitterness and trouble which has come to us
through that Hepburn line. First, there was my
brother Douglas, twenty-five years older than I am,
who, because he married the girl he loved, instead of
the one he didn’t, was sent adrift without a dollar.
Why didn’t my father, I wonder, marry into the line
himself, and so save all this trouble? Probably because
he was so far removed from the crisis now so
fast approaching, that he ventured to take my mother,
to whom he was always tender and loving, showing
that there was kindness in his nature, although he
could be so hard on Douglas and the dear little wife
who died when Gerold was born. Then came the terrible
time when both my father and mother were
swept away on the same day by the cholera, and six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>months after Douglas died, and his boy Gerold came to
live with us, He was two years my senior, and more
like my brother than my nephew, and I loved him
dearly and spoke up for him when Kizzy turned him
out, just as Douglas had been turned out before him.
Had I dared I would have written to him and assured
him of my love, but I could not, so great was my dread
of Keziah, who exercises a kind of hypnotic power
over us all. She tried to keep Desire from the man of
her choice, and might have succeeded, if death had not
forestalled her. She sent Tom away from me, and
only yielded to Maria, who had a will as strong as her
own and married whom she pleased. But she, too, died
just after her husband, who was shot in the battle of
Fredericksburgh, and we have no one left but her boy
Grant, who is almost as dear to me as Gerold was.</p>

<p class='c012'>Grant is a young man now, and I trust he will marry
Dorothea, and so break the evil spell which that old
man must have put upon us when to the long lease of
ninety years given to my grandfather he tacked that
strange condition that if before the expiration of the
lease a direct heir of Joseph Morton, of Woodford
County, Kentucky, married a direct heir of Amos Hepburn,
of Keswick, England, only half the value of the
property leased should revert to the Hepburn heir,
while the other half should remain in the Morton
family. If no such marriage has taken place, uniting
the houses of Morton and Hepburn, then the entire
property goes to the direct heir of the Hepburns. I
believe I have stated it as it is worded in that old yellow
document which Keziah keeps in the family Bible
and reads every day with a growing dread of what will
soon befall us unless Grant marries Dorothea, who, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>far as we know, stands first in the Hepburn line, and to
whom the Morton estate will go if it passes from our
hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have sometimes doubted if that clause would stand
the test of law, and have said so to Keziah, suggesting
to her to take advice on the subject. But she treated
my suggestion with scorn, charging me with wishing to
be dishonest, and saying that even if it were illegal it
was the request of Amos Hepburn, and father had instilled
it into her mind that a dead man’s wish was law,
and she should abide by it. Neither would she allow
me to ask any legal advice, or talk about the matter to
any one.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is our own business,” she said, “and if we choose
to give up our home it concerns no one but ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But she does not expect to give it up, for our hopes
are centred on Grant’s marrying Dorothea; and as one
means of accomplishing this end he must be kept from
Doris and all knowledge of her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Poor little orphaned Doris! I wonder what she is
like, and why Keziah is so hard upon her! She is not
to blame because her father married the daughter of
his landlady, whom Keziah calls a cook. How well I
recall a morning two or three years ago when, at the
tick of the clock announcing eight, Kizzy and Dizzy
and I marched solemnly down to breakfast just as we
have done for the last twenty years and shall for twenty
more if we live so long, Keziah first in her black dress
and lace cap, with her keys jingling at her side, Desire
next, in her white gown and blue ribbons, which she
will wear until she is seventy, and I, in my chintz
wrapper of lavender and white, colors which Tom said
were becoming to me and which I usually select. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>can hear the swish of our skirts on the stairs, and see
the round table with its china and glass and flowers,
and old Abe, the butler, bringing in the coffee and
toast, and a letter for Keziah, who read it twice, and
then, folding it very deliberately, said, “Gerold’s widow
is dead and has left a little girl, and a Rev. Mr. Wilmot
has written to know what is to be done with her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, bring her here, by all means!” both Dizzy and
I exclaimed in a breath, while Keziah’s face, which is
always severe and stern, grew more so as she replied,
in the tone from which there is no appeal, “She will
stay where she is, if there is a decent school there. I
shall educate her, of course; there is no alternative;
but she cannot come here until she is sufficiently cultivated
not to mortify us with her bad manners, as blood
will tell. I have never forgiven her mother for marrying
Gerold, and I cannot yet forgive this girl for being
that woman’s daughter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Both Desire and myself knew how useless it was to
combat Keziah when her mind was made up. So we
said nothing more about the child, and kept as much as
possible out of Keziah’s way, for when she is disturbed
she is not a pleasant person to meet in a <i><span lang="fr">tete-a-tete</span></i>. We
knew she wrote to Mr. Wilmot, and that he replied,
and then, two days after, when we went down to
breakfast, we found another letter for Keziah. It was
from Doris, and Keziah read it aloud, while her voice
and hands shook with wrath, and Desire and I exchanged
glances of satisfaction and touched each other
slyly with our feet in token of sympathy with the child,
who dared write thus to one who had ruled us so
long that we submitted to her now without a protest.
It was a very saucy letter, but it showed the mettle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the girl, and I respected her for it, and my heart went
out to her with a great pity when she said, “If you had
shown the least sympathy for me I could have loved
you so much, but you did not. You offered to care for
me because you felt that you must, but you never sent
me one word of pity or comfort.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Keziah,” I exclaimed at this point, “is that true?
Did you write to Mr. Wilmot and say no word to the
child?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never say what I do not feel,” was Keziah’s answer,
as she read on, and when she had finished the letter
she added, “She is an ungrateful girl, fitter for a dressmaker
or maid, no doubt, than for anything higher. But
she is a Morton, and must not be suffered to do a
menial’s work. I shall educate her in my own way, but
shall not recognize her socially until I know the kind of
woman into which she develops. Neither must you
waste any sentimentality upon her, or make any advances
in the shape of letters, for I will not have it.
Let her stand alone awhile. She seems to be equal to it.
And——” here she hesitated, while her pale cheek
flushed a little, as she continued, “she is older than I
supposed. She is fourteen,—very pretty, or beautiful,
I think Mr. Wilmot said, and that does not commend
her to me. You know how susceptible Grant is to
beauty, and there must be no more mistakes. The time
is too short for that. Grant is going to Andover,
which is not far from Meadowbrook, and if he knew of
this girl, who is his second cousin, nothing could keep
him from seeing her, and there is no telling what complications
might arise, for she is undoubtedly designing
like her mother, who won Gerold from the woman he
should have married. Consequently you are to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>nothing to Grant of this girl; then, if he chances to
meet her and trouble comes of it, I shall know the hand
of fate is in it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Keziah,” I remonstrated, “you surely cannot
expect that Grant will never know anything of Doris?
That is preposterous!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He need know nothing of her until matters are arranged
between him and Dorothea, who is only fifteen
now, while he is eighteen,—both too young as yet for an
engagement. But it must be. It shall be!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She spoke with great energy, and we, who knew her
so well, felt sure that it would be, and knew that so far
as Grant or any of us were concerned, Doris was to remain
a myth until such time as Keziah chose to bring
her home. But if we could not speak of her to Grant,
Desire and I talked of her often between ourselves,
and two or three times I began a letter to her, but always
burned it, so great was my fear of Keziah’s displeasure
should she find it out. We knew the girl was
well cared for and happy, and that she stood high in all
her classes, for the very best of reports came regularly
from her teachers, both with regard to deportment and
to scholarship. Perhaps I am wrong, but I cannot help
thinking that Keziah would have been better pleased if
some fault had been found in order to confirm her
theory that blood will tell. But there has been none,
and she was graduated with honor at the High School
in Meadowbrook, and every arrangement was made for
her to go to Madame De Moisiere’s school in Boston,
where she particularly wished to go, when suddenly
Keziah changed her mind in favor of Wellesley, where
Doris did not wish to go. “She is bitterly disappointed,
and I shall be glad if you can think best to adhere to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>your first plan,” Mr. Wilmot wrote, but did not move
Keziah a whit. It was either Wellesley or some out-of-the-way
place in Maine, which I do not recall. Doris
has chosen Wellesley, of course, while Dizzy and I have
put our wits to work to find the cause of the change,
and I think we have found it. Dorothea has suddenly
made up her mind to go to Madame De Moisiere.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t care for books, any way,” she wrote. “I am a
dunce, and everybody knows it and seems to like me
just as well. But old Gardy thinks I ought to go somewhere
to be finished, and so I have chosen De Moisiere,
where I expect to have no end of fun provided I can
hoodwink the teachers, and I think I can. Besides,
as you may suspect, the fact that Grant has finished
Andover and is now in Harvard has a good deal to do
with my choice, for he will call upon me, of course. I
shall be so proud of him, as I hear he is very popular,
and all the girls will be green with envy!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The dear rattle-brained child,” Keziah said, chuckling
over the letter, as she would not have chuckled if it
had been from Doris,—“the dear rattle-brained child!
Of course Grant must call, and I shall write to the professors,
giving my permission, and to Madame asking
her to allow him to see her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Poor, innocent Kizzy! It is so many years since she
was at boarding-school, where she was kept behind bars
and bolts, and she knows so little how fast the world
has moved since then, that she really believes young
people are kept as closely now as they were forty years
ago. What would she say if she knew how many times
Grant was at Madame’s while he was at Andover and
during his first year at Harvard, and how many flirtations
he has had with the girls, whom he calls a jolly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>lot. All this he confided to Dizzy and myself, when at
the vacation he came home, fresh and breezy and full
of fun and frolic and noise, making our quiet house resound
with his college songs and Harvard yells, which
I think are hideous, and rather fast, if not low. But
Kizzy never utters a word of protest, and pays without
questioning the enormous bills sent to her, and seems
gratified to know that his rooms are as handsome and
his turnout as fine as any in Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c012'>Grant has the first place in Kizzy’s heart, and Dorothea
the next, and because she is going to Madame De
Moisiere, Doris must not go, for naturally she would
fall in with Dorothea, and through her with Grant, who
would not be insensible to his pretty cousin’s charms,
and who would resent his having been kept from her
so long. Mr. Wilmot has written that she is exceedingly
beautiful, with a manner which attracts every one,
while some of her teachers have written the same.
Dorothea, on the contrary, is rather plain. “Ugly as a
hedge fence,” Grant once said of her in a fit of pique,
declaring that if he ever married, it would be to a pretty
face. And so he must not see Doris until he is engaged
to Dorothea, as it seems likely he soon will be,
and Doris is going to Wellesley, where Kizzy thinks
Grant has never been and never can go without her
permission! Deluded Kizzy! Grant knows at least a
dozen Wellesley girls, each one of whom he designates
a brick. Will he find Doris, I wonder? I cannot help
hoping so. Ah, well, the world is a queer mixture, and
<i><span lang="fr">nous verrons</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is growing late, and everybody in and around the
house is asleep, except myself and Nero, the watch-dog,
who is fiercely baying the moon or barking at some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>thieving negro stealing our eggs or chickens. The
clock is striking twelve, and I must say good-night to
my journal and to Tom, if he is still alive, and to dear
little Doris: so leaning from my window into the cool
night air, I will kiss my hand to the north and south
and east and west, and say God bless them both, wherever
they are.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.—<span class='sc'>Doris’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>GRANTLEY MONTAGUE AND DOROTHEA.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was a lovely morning in September when, with
Lucy Pierce, a girl friend, I took the train for Boston,
where I was to spend the night with Lucy’s aunt, who
lived there, and the next day go to Wellesley. Soon
after we were seated, a young man who had formerly
lived in Meadowbrook, but was now a clerk in some
house in Chicago and was going to Boston on business,
entered the car, and after the first greetings were over,
said to us, “I saw you get in at Meadowbrook, and
have come to speak with you and have a little rest.
The through sleeper from Chicago and Cincinnati is half
full of school-girls and Harvard boys, who have
kept up such a row. Why, it was after twelve last
night before they gave us a chance to sleep. They are
having a concert now, and a girl from Cincinnati, whom
they call Thea, and who seems to be the ringleader, is
playing the banjo, while another shakes a tambourine,
and a tall fellow from Kentucky, whom they call General
Grant, is whistling an accompaniment. I rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>think Miss Thea is pretty far gone with the general, the
way she turns her great black eyes on him, and I
wouldn’t wonder if he were a little mashed on her,
although she is not what I call pretty. And yet she
has a face which one would look at twice, and like it
better the second time than the first; and, by Jove, she
handles that banjo well. I wish you could see her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When we reached Worcester, where we were to stop
a few minutes, Lucy and I went into the sleeper, from
which many of the passengers had alighted, leaving it
free to the girls and the Harvards, who were enjoying
themselves to their utmost. The concert was at its
height, banjo and tambourine-players and whistler all
doing their best, and it must be confessed that the best
was very good. Thea was evidently the centre of attraction,
as, with her hat off and her curly bangs
pushed back from her forehead, her white fingers swept
the strings of the banjo with a certain inimitable grace,
and her brilliant, laughing eyes looked up to the young
man, who was bending over her with his back to me so
I could not see his face. I only knew he was tall and
broad-shouldered, with light brown hair which curled
at the ends, and that his appearance was that of one
bred in a city, who has never done anything in his life
but enjoy himself. And still he fascinated me almost
as much as Thea, who, as I passed her, said to him, with
a soft Southern accent, “For shame, Grant,—to make
so horrid a discord! I believe you did it on purpose,
and I shall not play any more. The concert is ended;
pass round the hat;” and, dropping her banjo on her
lap and running her fingers through her short hair
until it stood up all over her head, she leaned back as if
exhausted and fanned herself with her sailor hat. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the exception of her eyes and hair, she was not pretty
in the usual acceptation of the term. But, as young
Herring had said, one would turn to look at her twice
and like her better the second time than the first, for
there was an irresistible charm in her manner and smile
and voice, which to me seemed better than mere beauty
of feature and complexion.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he reached the depot in Boston I saw her
again, and then thought her very pretty as she stood
upon the platform, taking her numerous parcels from
“General” Grant, with whom she was gayly chattering.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now mind you come soon. I shall be so homesick
till I see you. I am half homesick now,” she said,
brushing a tear, either real or feigned, from her eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But suppose they won’t let me call? They are
awfully stiff when they get their backs up, and they
are not very fond of me,” the young man said, and she
replied, “Oh, they will, for your aunt and Gardy are
going to write and ask permission for me to see you, so
that is fixed. <i><span lang="fr">Au revoir.</span></i>” And, kissing her fingers to
him, she followed her companions, while Grant went to
look for his baggage.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had been standing with his back to me, but as he
turned I saw his face distinctly and started involuntarily
with the thought that I had seen him before, or somebody
like him. Surely there was something familiar
about him, and the memory of my dead father came
back to me and was associated with this young man,
thoughts of whom clung to me persistently, until the
strangeness and novelty of Wellesley drove him and
Thea from my mind for a time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of my student life at Wellesley, I shall say but little,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>except that as a student I was contented and happy. I
loved study for its own sake, and no task was too long,
no lesson too hard, for me to master. I stood high in
all my classes, and was popular with my teachers and
the few girls whom I chose as my friends. And still
there was constantly with me a feeling of unrest,—a
longing for something I could not have. Mordecai sat
in the gate, and my Mordecai was the restrictions with
which my Aunt Keziah hedged me round, not only in a
letter written to my teachers, but in one which she sent
to me when I had been in Wellesley three or four weeks.
I was not expecting it, and at the sight of her handwriting
my heart gave a great bound, for she was my
blood relation, and although I had no reason to love
her, I had more than once found myself wishing for
some recognition from her. At last it had come, I
thought, and with moist eyes and trembling hands I
opened the letter, which was as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Doris</span>,—It has come to my knowledge that a
great deal more license is allowed to young people than
in my day, and that young men sometimes call upon
or manage to see school-girls without the permission of
their parents or guardians. This is very reprehensible,
and something I cannot sanction. I am at a great expense
for your education, in order that you may do
credit to your father’s name, and I wish you to devote
your entire energies and thoughts to your books, and
on no account to receive calls or attentions of any kind
from any one, and especially a Harvard student. My
orders are strict in this respect, and I have communicated
them to your Principal. You can, if accompanied
by a teacher, go occasionally to a concert or a lecture in
Boston, but, as a rule you are better in the building,
and must have nothing to do with the Harvarders.
Your past record is good and I expect your future to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>be the same, and shall be pleased accordingly. I shall
send your quarter’s spending money to Miss ——, who
will give it to you as you need it, and I do this because
I hear that girls at school are sometimes given to buying
candy by the box,—French candy, too,—and sweets
by the jar, and to having <em>spreads</em>, whatever these may
be. But you can afford none of these extravagancies,
and, lest you should be tempted to indulge in them, I
have removed the possibility from your way by giving
your allowance to Miss ——, and I wish you to keep an
account of all your little incidental expenses, and send
it to me with the quarterly reports of your standing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have arranged with the Wilmots for you to spend
your vacations with them. But when your education
is finished, if your record is as good as it has been, you
will come to us, of course, if we have a home for you to
come to. There is a dark cloud hanging over us, and
whether it will burst or not I cannot tell. If it does,
you may be obliged to earn your own living, and hence
the necessity for you to get a thorough education. I am
thankful to say that, for people of our years, your aunts
and myself are in comfortable health. If you wish to
write me occasionally and tell me of your life at Wellesley,
you can do so, but you must not expect prompt replies,
as people at my time of life are not given to voluminous
correspondence.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>I had opened the letter with eager anticipations of
what it might contain, but when I finished it my heart
was hardening with a sense of the injustice done me by
treating me as if I were a little child, who could not be
trusted with my own pocket money, and who was to
give an account for every penny spent, from a postage
stamp to a car fare. And this at first hurt me worse
than the other restrictions. I did not know much about
the Harvard boys or spreads, and I did not care especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>for French candy and sweets, but now that they
were so summarily forbidden, I began to want them and
to rebel against the chains which bound me, and as the
weeks and months went on, I became more and more
conscious of a feeling of desolation and loneliness, which
at times made me very unhappy. In Meadowbrook I
had been so kindly cared for by the Wilmots that, except
for the sense of loss when I thought of my mother,
I had not fully realized how alone I was in the world;
but at Wellesley, when I heard my companions talk of
their homes and saw their delight when letters came to
them from father or mother or brothers or sisters, I
used to go away and cry with an intense longing for the
love of some one of my own kindred and friends. I had
no letters from home and no home to go to during the
vacations except that of the Wilmots, who always made
me welcome. I stood alone, a sort of <em>goody-goody</em>, as the
girls called me when I resisted their entreaties to join
in violation of the rules. I took no part in what Aunt
Keziah called spreads. I seldom saw a Harvard student,
but heard a good deal about them and learned
that they were not the monsters Aunt Kizzy thought
them to be.</p>

<p class='c012'>My room-mate, Mabel Stearns, had a brother in
Harvard, whose intimate friend was called General
Grant, but whose real name was Grantley Montague,
Mabel said, adding that he was a Kentuckian and belonged
to a very aristocratic family. He was reported
to be rich, spending his money freely, and while always
managing to have his lessons and stand well with the
professors, still arranging to have a hand in every bit
of fun and frolic that came in his way. I heard, too, of
Dorothea Haynes, who was at Madame De Mosiere’s,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>She was a great heiress and an orphan, and lived in Cincinnati
with her guardian, whom she called old Gardy,
who gave her all the money she wanted, and whose
instructions were that, as she was delicate, she was not
to have too many lessons or study too hard. Like
Grantley Montague, she was very popular, and no one
had so many callers from Harvard. Prominent among
these was Grantley Montague, who was very lover-like
in his attentions. Happy Dorothea Haynes, I thought,
envying her for her money,—which was not doled out
to her in quarters and halves,—envying her for her
freedom, and envying her most for her acquaintance
with Grantley Montague, who occupied much of my
thoughts, but who seemed as far removed from me as
the planets from the earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>I never went anywhere, except occasionally to a concert,
or a lecture, and to church. I seldom saw anyone
except the teachers and students around me, and,
although I was very fond of my books, time dragged
rather monotonously with me until I had been at
Wellesley about two and a half years, when Mabel who
had spent Sunday in Boston came back on Monday
radiant and full of news which she hastened to communicate.
Grantley Montague and her brother Fred
were soon to give a tea-party under the auspices of her
married sister, who lived in Cambridge, and who was
to be assisted by two or three other ladies. I had heard
of these receptions, where Thea Haynes usually figured
so prominently in wonderful costumes, but if any wish
that I might have part in them ever entered my mind,
it was quickly smothered, for such things were not for
me, fettered as I was by my aunt Keziah’s orders, which
were not relaxed in the least, although I was now nineteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>years of age. How then was I surprised and
delighted when with Mabel’s invitation there came one
for me! It was through her influence, I knew, but I
was invited, and for a few moments I was happier than
I had ever been in my life. Then came the thought
expressed in words, “Can I go?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly,” Mabel said; “you have only to write
your aunt, who will say yes at once, if you tell her how
much you desire it, and Miss —— will give her permission
gladly, for you are the model scholar. You never
get into scrapes, and have scarcely had an outing
except a few stupid lectures or concerts with a teacher
tacked on, and I don’t believe you have spoken to a
Harvarder since you have been here. Of course she
will let you go; if she don’t, she’s an old she-dragon.
Write to her at once, and blarney her a little, if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I did not know how to blarney, and I was horribly
afraid of the she-dragon, as Mabel called her, but I
wrote her that day, telling her what I wanted, and how
much pleasure it would give me to go. It was the first
favor I had asked, I said, and I had tried so hard to do
what I thought would please her, that I hoped she
would grant it, and, as there was not very much time
for delay, would she please telegraph her answer? I
signed myself, “Your affectionate niece, Doris Morton,”
and then waited, anxiously, for a reply. I knew about
how long it took for a letter to reach Morton Park, and
on the fourth day after mine was sent I grew so nervous
that I could scarcely eat or keep my mind upon my lessons.
Encouraged by Mabel, I had come to think it
quite sure that my aunt would consent, and had tried
on my two evening dresses to see which was the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>becoming to me, crimson surah with creamy trimmings,
or cream-colored cashmere with crimson trimmings.
Mabel decided for the cashmere, which, she said, softened
my brilliant color, and I sewed a bit of lace into
the neck and fastened a bow of ribbon a little more securely,
and was smoothing the folds of the dress and
wondering what Grantley Montague would think of it
and me, when there was a knock at my door and a telegram
was handed me. I think the sight of one of
those yellow missives quickens the pulse of every one,
and for a moment my heart beat so fast that I could
scarcely stand. I was alone, for Mabel had gone out,
and, dropping into a chair, I opened the envelope with
hands which shook as if I were in a chill. Then everything
swam before my eyes and grew misty, except the
one word <em>No</em>, which stamped itself upon my brain so
indelibly that I see it now as distinctly as I saw it then,
and I feel again the pang of disappointment and the
sensation as if my heart were beating in my throat and
choking me to death. I remember trying to cry, with a
thought that tears might remove the pressure in my
head, which was like a band of steel. But I could not,
and for a few moments I sat staring at the word <em>No</em>,
which for a time turned me into stone. Then I arose
and hung up the dress I was not to wear, and put away
the long gloves I had bought to go with it, and was
standing by the window, looking drearily out upon the
wintry sky, when Mabel came in, full of excitement and
loaded with parcels.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had been shopping in Boston, and she displayed
one after another the slippers and fan and handkerchief
she had bought for the great occasion of which she had
heard so much. Grantley Montague, she said, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>sparing no pains to make it the very finest affair of the
season, and Thea Haynes was having a wonderful costume
made, although she already had a dozen Paris
gowns in her wardrobe. Then, as I did not enter very
heartily into her talk, she suddenly stopped, and, looking
me in the face, exclaimed, “What is it, Dorey?
Has the answer come?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I nodded, and spying the dispatch on the table, she
snatched it up and read <em>No</em>, and then began pirouetting
wildly around the room, with exclamations not very
complimentary to my aunt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The vile old cat!” she said. “What does she mean
by treating you so, and you the model who never do
anything out of the way, and have never been known
to join in the least bit of a lark? But I would spite the
hateful old woman. I’d be bad if I were you. Suppose
you jump out of the window to-night, or do something
to assert your rights. Will you? A lot of us will
help.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She had expressed aloud much that had passed through
my mind during the last hour. What was the use of
being a <em>goody-goody</em>, as I was so often called? Why not
be a <em>bady-bady</em> and taste forbidden fruit for once? I had
asked myself, half resolving to throw off all restraint
and see how bad I could be. But when I thought of my
teachers, who trusted me and whom I loved, and more
than all when I remembered my dead mother’s words,
“If your aunts care for you, respect their wishes as you
would mine,” my mood changed. I would do right
whatever came; and I said so to Mabel, who called me
a milksop and sundry other names equally expressive,
and declared she would not tell me a thing about
the reception. But I knew she would, and she did, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>for days after it I heard of little else than the <em>perfectly
elegant</em> affair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such beautiful rooms,” she said, “with so many
pictures, and among them such a funny one of four old
women sitting in a row, like owls on a pole, with a
moon-faced baby in the lap of one of them, and a
young man behind them. It has a magnificent frame,
and I meant to have asked its history, but forgot it,
there was so much else to look at.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I wonder now that I did not think of my father’s picture
of his four aunts, which was sold to a Boston dealer
years before; but I did not, and Mabel rattled on, telling
me of the guests, and the dresses, especially that of
Thea Haynes, which she did not like; it was too low in
front and too low in the back, and fitted her form too
closely, and the sleeves were too short for her thin
arms.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But then it was all right because it was Thea
Haynes, and she is very nice and agreeable and striking,
with winning manners and a sweet voice,” she said.
“Everybody was ready to bow down to her, except
Grantley Montague, who was just as polite to one as to
another, and who sometimes seemed annoyed at the way
she monopolized him, as if he were her special property.
I am so sorry you were not there, as you would have
thrown her quite in the shade, for you are a thousand
times handsomer than she.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was of course flattering to my vanity, but it did
not remove the feeling of disappointment, which lasted
for a long time and was not greatly lessened when
about a week after the reception I received from Aunt
Keziah a letter which I knew was meant to be conciliatory.
She was sorry, she said, to have to refuse the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>favor I had ever asked, but she had good reasons, which
she might some time see fit to tell me, and then she
referred again to a shadow which was hanging over the
family, and which made her morbid, she supposed. I
had no idea what the shadow was, or what connection
it had with my going to Grantley Montague’s reception,
but I was glad she was making even a slight
apology for what seemed to me so unjust. She was
much pleased with the good reports of me, she said, and
if I liked I might attend a famous opera which she
heard was soon to be in Boston, and I could have one
of those long wraps trimmed with fur such as young
girls wore to evening entertainments, and a new silk
dress, if I needed it. That was very kind, and Mabel,
to whom I showed the letter, declared that the dragon
must have met with a change of heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d go to the opera,” she said, “and I’d have the
wrap trimmed with light fur, and the gown a grayish
blue, just the color of your eyes when you are excited.
There are some lovely patterns at Jordan &#38; Marsh’s,
and sister Clara will help you pick it out, and we’ll have
a box and go with Clara, and I’ll do your hair beautifully,
and you’ll see how many glasses will be leveled
at you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mabel was always comforting and enthusiastic, and I
began to feel a good deal of interest in the box and the
dress and the wrap and the opera, which I enjoyed immensely,
and where so many glasses were turned towards
me that my cheeks burned as if I were a culprit
caught in some wrong act. But there was something
lacking, and that was Grantley Montague, whom I fully
expected to see. Neither he nor Thea was there, and
I heard afterwards that she was ill with a cold and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>written a pathetic note, begging him not to go and enjoy
himself when she was feeling so badly and crying
on her pillow, with her nose a sight to behold. Mabel’s
brother, who reported this to her, added that when
Grantley read the note he gave a mild little swear and
said he reckoned he should go if he liked. But he
didn’t, and I neither saw him then, nor any time afterwards,
except in the distance, during my stay at Wellesley.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was graduated the next summer, and left for
Kentucky, with the reputation of a fair scholar and a
first-rate fellow who had spent quite a fortune during
his college course. Thea Haynes also left Madame’s,
where she said she had learned nothing, generously adding,
however, that it was not the fault of her teachers,
but because she didn’t try. Some time during the next
autumn I heard that she had gone to Europe with her
guardian and maid and a middle-aged governess who
acted as chaperon, and that Grantley Montague was
soon to join her in a trip to Egypt. After that I knew no
more of them except as Mabel occasionally told me what
she heard from her brother, who had also left Harvard
and was in San Francisco. To him Grantley wrote in
February that he was with the Haynes party, which
had been increased by a second or third cousin of
Thea’s, a certain Aleck Grady, who was a crank, and
perfectly daft on the subject of a family tree and the
missing link in the Hepburn line.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If he finds the missing link,” Fred wrote to his
sister, “Grant says it will take quite a fortune from
Thea, or himself, or both; and he seems to be a little
anxious about the link which Aleck Grady is trying to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>find. I don’t know what it means. Think I’ll ask him
to explain more definitely when I write him again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Neither Mabel nor I could hazard a guess with regard
to the missing link or the Hepburn line, and I soon forgot
them entirely in the excitement of preparing for my
graduation, which was not very far away. I had hoped
that one of my aunts at least would be present, and had
written to that effect to Aunt Keziah, telling her how
lonely it would be for me with no relative present, and
how earnestly I wished that either she or Aunt Desire
or Aunt Beriah would come. I even went so far as to
thank her for all she had done for me and to tell her
how sorry I was for the saucy letter I wrote to her six
years ago. I had often wanted to do this, but had
never quite made up my mind to it until now, when I
hoped it might bring me a favorable response. But I
was mistaken.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not possible for herself or either of her sisters
to come so far, she wrote. She appreciated my wish to
have her there, she said, and did not esteem me less for
it. But it could not be. She enclosed money for my
graduating dress, and also for my traveling expenses,
for after a brief rest in Meadowbrook I was going to
Morton Park, in charge of a merchant from Frankfort,
who would be in New York in July and would meet me
in Albany. And so, with no relative present to encourage
me or be proud of me, I received my diploma and
more flowers than I knew what to do with, and compliments
enough to turn my head, and then, amid tears
and kisses and good wishes, bade farewell to my girl
friends and teachers, one of whom said to me at parting:
“If all our pupils were like you, Wellesley would be a
Paradise.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>A model in every respect they called me, and it was
with quite a high opinion of myself that I went to
Meadowbrook, where I spent a week, and then, bidding
a tearful good-bye to the friends who had been so kind
to me, I joined Mr. Jones at Albany, and was soon on
my way to Kentucky.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Nearly everybody keeps a diary at some time in his
life, I think. Aunt Brier does, I know, and Thea, and
Aleck,—confound him, with his Hepburn lines and missing
links!—and so I may as well be in fashion and
commence one, even if I tear it up, as I probably shall.
Well, here we are in Florence, and likely to be until
Thea is able to travel. Why did she go tearing around
Rome night and day in all sorts of weather, spooning it
in the Coliseum by moonlight and declaring she was <em>oh,
so hot</em>, when my teeth were chattering with cold, and I
could see nothing in the beauty she raved about but some
old broken walls and arches, with shadows here and
there, which did not look half as pretty as the shadows
in the park at home? Europe hasn’t panned out exactly
as I thought it would, and I am getting confoundedly
bored. Thea is nice, of course,—too nice, in fact,—but
a fellow does not want to be compelled to marry a girl
any way. He’d rather have some choice in the matter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>which I haven’t had; but I like Thea immensely, and
we are engaged.</p>

<p class='c012'>There, I’ve blurted it out, and it looks first-rate on
paper, too. Yes, we are engaged, and this is how it
happened. Ever since I was knee-high Aunt Keziah
has dinged it into me that I must marry Thea, or her
heart would be broken, and the Mortons beggared. I
wish old Amos Hepburn’s hand had been paralyzed
before he added to that long lease a condition which has
brought grief to my Uncle Douglas and cousin Gerold,
who married an actress, or a cook, or something, because
he loved her more than he did money. By George, I
respect him for his independence, and wish I were more
like him, and not a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow who
does not know how to do a single useful thing or to earn
a dollar.</p>

<p class='c012'>Well, the time is drawing near for that lease to expire,
and unless a direct heir of Joseph Morton, my
great-grandfather, marries a direct heir of Amos Hepburn,
the entire Morton estate will revert to the Hepburn
heir. Now, I am a direct heir of Joseph Morton,
and Thea is old Hepburn’s direct heir, which means, according
to the way it was explained in the lease, that
she is the eldest child, whether son or daughter, of the
eldest child, and so on back to the beginning, when there
were three daughters of old Amos. Thea comes from
the second of these daughters, for where the first one
is the Lord only knows. Aleck Grady descends from
old Amos’s third daughter, and has no chance while
Thea lives. Nor does he pretend to want any, as he has
money enough of his own. He joined our party uninvited
in Egypt, and has bored us to death with his
family tree, and the missing link, which link means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the eldest daughter of old Hepburn, of whom nothing
is known after a certain date. And it is she and
her descendants, if there are any, he is trying to
hunt up. He is a shrewd fellow, and a kind of quack
lawyer, too, and once told me that he did not think the
long lease would hold water a minute in the United
States, and asked if Aunt Keziah had consulted a first-class
lawyer, and when I told him that she had not,—that
it had been a rule in our family not to talk about
the lease to any one until compelled to do so, and that
even if she knew the document was invalid she would
consider herself bound in honor to respect it as her
father had done before her and enjoined her to do,—he
shrugged his shoulders and said, “<i><span lang="fr">Chacun à son goût</span></i>;
but I should dispute that lease inch by inch, and beat
the Hepburns too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, then,” I asked, “are you so anxious to find the
<em>missing link</em>, as you call it? I always supposed that for
some reason you wanted to throw Thea out of the
property.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With that insinuating smile of his which Thea thinks
so winning and I think so disgusting, he replied, “My
dear fellow, how you mistake me! I don’t care a picayune
who gets the Morton money, if you are fools enough
to give it up. But I do care for my ancestors; in fact,
I have a real affection for my great-aunt Octavia, and
am most anxious to know what became of her and her
progeny. I have her as far as New York, where all
trace of her is lost. Would you like to see the family
tree?”</p>

<p class='c012'>As I had seen it half a dozen times and knew exactly
where Octavia failed to connect, I declined, and then
the conversation turned upon Thea, who, Aleck said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>was a very nice girl, but a little too fast, and had about
her too much gush and too much powder to suit him.
It was strange why girls would gush and giggle and
plaster their faces with cosmetics and blacken their eyebrows
until they looked like women of the town, he said,
appealing to me for confirmation of his opinion. I had
more than half suspected him of designs on Thea, and
I flamed up at once in her defense, telling him she
neither gushed, nor powdered, nor blackened,—three
lies, as I knew,—but I was angry, and when, with that
imperturbable good humor which never fails him, he
continued: “Don’t get so mad, I beg. I am older than
you, and know human nature better than you do, and I
know you pretty well. Why, I’ve made you quite a
study. Thea, in spite of her powder and gush, is a
splendid girl, and will make a good wife to the man she
loves and who loves her, but she is not your ideal, and
pardon me for suggesting that I don’t believe that you
would marry her if it were not for that clause about the
eldest heir, which I don’t think is worth the paper it is
written on,”—I could have knocked him down, he was
so cool and patronizing, and was also telling me a good
deal of truth. But I would not admit it, and insisted
that I would marry Thea if there had never been any
Hepburn line and she had not a dollar in the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why don’t you propose, then, and done with it?
She is dying to have you,” he said, and I declared I
would, and that night I asked her to be my wife, and I
have not regretted it either, although I know she is not
my ideal.</p>

<p class='c012'>But who is my ideal, and where is she, if I have one?
I am sure I don’t know, unless it is the owner of a face
which I have seen but twice, but which comes back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>me over and over again, and which I would not forget
if I could, and could not if I would. The first time I
saw it was at a concert in Boston, not long before I left
college. I was in the dress-circle, and diagonally to my
right was an immense bonnet or hat which hid half the
audience from me. Late in the evening it moved, and
I saw beyond it a face which has haunted me ever
since. It was that of a young and beautiful girl, who I
instinctively felt belonged to a type entirely different
from the class of girls whom I had known while at Harvard,
and who, without being exactly fast in the worst
acceptation of the term, had come so near the boundary-line
between propriety and impropriety that it was difficult
to tell on which side they stood. But this girl was
different, with her deep-blue eyes and her wavy hair
which I was sure had never come in contact with the
hot curling-tongs, as Thea’s does, while her complexion,
which reminded me of the roses and lilies in Aunt
Keziah’s garden, owed none of its brilliancy to cosmetics,
as Aleck says most complexions do. She was real,
and inexpressibly lovely, especially when she smiled, as
she sometimes did upon the lady who sat beside her,
and who might have been her mother, or her chaperone,
or some elderly relative. When the concert was over I
hurried out, hoping to get near her, but she was lost in
the crowd, and I only saw her once again, three weeks
later, in an open street-car going in the opposite direction
from the one in which I was seated. In her hand
she held a paper parcel, which made me think she might
possibly be a seamstress or a saleslady, and I spent a
great deal of time haunting the establishments in Boston
which employed girls as clerks, but I never found her,
nor heard of her. She certainly was not at Moisiere’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and I don’t think she was at Wellesley, as I am sure I
should have heard of her through Fred, who had a sister
there. Once I thought I would tell him about her, but
was kept from doing so by a wish to discover her myself,
and when discovered to keep her to myself. But I have
never seen her since the day she went riding so serenely
past me, unconscious of the admiration and strange
emotions she was exciting in me. Who was she, I wonder;
and shall I ever see her again? It is not likely;
and if I do, what can it matter to me, now that I am
engaged to Thea?</p>

<p class='c012'>In her letter of congratulation Aunt Keziah, who was
wild with delight, wrote to me that nothing could make
her so happy as my marriage with Thea, and that she
knew I would keep my promise, no matter whom I
might meet, for no one of Morton blood ever proved
untrue to the woman he loved. Of course I shall prove
true; and who is there to meet, unless it is my Lost
Star, as I call her, for whom I believe I am as persistently
searching as Aleck is for the missing link, for I
never see a group of young American girls that I do
not manage to get near enough to see if she is among
them, and I never see a head of chestnut-brown hair set
on shoulders just as hers was that I don’t follow it until
I see the face, which as yet has not been hers. And in
this I am not disloyal to Thea, whom I love better than
any girl I have ever known, and whom I will make
happy, if possible. She has been ill now nearly four
weeks, but in a few days we hope to move on to Paris,
where we shall stay until June, then go to Switzerland,
and some time in the autumn sail for home, and the
aunts who have vied with each other in spoiling me and
are the dearest aunts in the world, although so unlike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>each other,—Aunt Keziah, with her iron will but really
kind heart, Aunt Dizzy, with her invalid airs and pretty
youthful ways which suit her so well in spite of her
years, and Aunt Brier, whose name is a misnomer, she
is so soft and gentle, with nothing scratchy about her,
and who has such a sad, sweet face, with a look in her
brown eyes as if she were always waiting or listening
for something. I believe she has a history, and that it
is in some way connected with that queer chap, Bey
Atkins they called him, whose dress was half Oriental
and half European, and whom I met at Shepheard’s in
Cairo. I first saw him the night after our return from
the trip up the Nile. He registered just after I had
written the names of our party, at which he looked a
long time, and then fairly shadowed me until he had a
chance to speak to me alone. It was after dinner, and
we were sitting near each other in front of the hotel,
when he began to talk to me, and in an inconceivably
short space of time had learned who I was, and where
I lived, and about my aunts, in whom he seemed so
greatly interested, especially Aunt Brier, that I finally
asked if he had ever been to Morton Park.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he answered, knocking the ashes from his
cigar and leaning back in the bamboo chair in the
graceful, lounging way he has,—“yes, years ago I was
in Versailles and visited at Morton Park. Your aunt
Beriah and I were great friends. Tell her when you
go home that you saw Tom Atkins in Cairo, and that
he has become a kind of wandering Ishmael and wears
a red fez and white flannel suit. Tell her, too—” but
here he stopped suddenly, and, rising, went into the
street, where his dragoman was holding the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>donkey he always rode, sometimes alone and sometimes
with a little girl beside him, who called him father.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, then, he is married, and his wife must be
an Arab, for the child was certainly of that race, with
her great dark eyes and her tawny hair all in a tangle.
I meant to ask him about her, but when next day I
inquired for him, I was told that he had gone to his
home near Alexandria, where, I dare say, there is a
host of little Arabs, and a woman with a veil stretched
across her nose, whom he calls his wife.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alas for Aunt Brier if my conjecture is right!</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER V.—<span class='sc'>Beriah’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>DORIS AND THE GLORY HOLE.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It is a long time since I have opened my journal, for
there is so little to record. Life at Morton Park goes
on in the same monotonous routine, with no change
except of servants, of which we have had a sufficiency
ever since the negroes became “ekels,” as our last importation
from Louisville, who rejoiced in the high-sounding
name of Helena Maude, informed us they
were. Such things make Keziah furious, for she is a
regular fire-eater, but I shall admit their equality provided
they spare my best bonnet and do not insist upon
putting their knives into our butter. Helena Maude is
a pretty good girl, and when some of her friends come
to the front door and ask if Miss Smithson lives here I
tell them yes, and send them round to the cabins and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>say nothing to Keziah, who for the last few weeks has
been wholly absorbed in other matters than colored
gentry.</p>

<p class='c012'>Doris is coming home to-morrow, and just the
thought of it makes me so nervous with gladness that I
can scarcely write legibly. I think it was a struggle for
Keziah to consent to her coming, and she only did so
after she heard Grant was engaged to Dorothea. I
never saw Keziah as happy as she was upon the receipt
of Grant’s letter, for his marriage with Dorothea means
keeping our old home, and she allowed Helena Maude
to whistle “Marching Through Georgia” as she cleared
the table, and did not reprove her. It was soon after
this that she announced her intention to bring Doris to
Morton Park after her graduation, and that night Dizzy
and I held a kind of jubilee in our sitting-room, we were
so glad that at last Gerold’s daughter was coming to
her father’s old home.</p>

<p class='c012'>We need young blood here to keep us from stagnating,
and although Grantley will be with us in the autumn,
and possibly Dorothea, we know what they are, and are
anxious for something new and fresh and pretty like
Doris. I have a photograph of her, and it stands before
me as I write, a picture of a wondrously beautiful
young girl, with great earnest eyes confronting mine
so steadfastly, and masses of soft, natural curls all over
her head after the fashion of the present day. I know
they are natural, although Keziah says they are the result
of hot tongs, and that she shall stop it at once, for
she will not have the gas turned on half the time
while the irons are heating. That is Dorothea’s style;
but she is in the Hepburn line, and is to marry Grant,
which makes a difference.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Doris sent such a nice letter to Keziah, asking pardon
for the saucy things she wrote to her years ago, and
begging that some one of us would come to see her
graduated. How I wanted to go! but Keziah said we
could not afford it, as she intended buying a new upright
Steinway in place of the old spindle-legged thing
on which she used to thrum when a girl. We have
heard that Doris is a fine musician, but Keziah will not
admit that the piano was bought for her. Dorothea
will visit us in the autumn, she says, and she wishes to
make it as pleasant as possible for her. Dizzy and I
both know what Dorothea’s playing is like, and that it
does not matter much whether it is on a Steinway or a
tin pan, but we are glad for something modern in our
ancient drawing-room, where every article of furniture
is nearly as old as I am, and where the new Steinway is
now standing with one of Keziah’s shawls thrown over
it to keep it from the dust.</p>

<p class='c012'>For once in our lives Dizzy and I have waged a
fierce battle with Keziah, who came off victor as usual.
The battle was over Doris’s room, which Keziah thinks
is of little consequence. Looking at our house from
the outside, one would say it was large enough to accommodate
a dozen school-girls; but looks are deceptive,
and it seems it can hardly accommodate one.
There is a broad piazza in front, and through the centre
a long and wide hall, after the fashion of most Southern
houses. On the south side of the hall are the drawing-room
and sitting-room, with fireplaces in each. On the
north side are the dining-room and Keziah’s sleeping-room,
where she usually sits and receives her intimate
friends. On the floor above are also four rooms,—Dizzy’s
and mine, which open together on the north side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>of the hall, and on the other side Grantley’s, and the
guest-room, which has not been occupied in fifteen years,
for when Dorothea is here she has always had a cot in
my room or Dizzy’s. At the end of the hall is a small
room, ten by twelve perhaps, and communicating with
the guest-chamber, for which it was originally intended
as a dressing-room, but which we use as a store-room
for a most heterogeneous mass of rubbish, such as
broken chairs and stands and trunks and chests, and old
clothes and warming-pans and water-bags and Grantley’s
fishing-tackle. The Glory Hole, we call it, though
what the name has to do with the room I have no idea.
There is a tradition that Gerold, when he first looked
into it, exclaimed, “Oh, glory, what a hole!” and hence
the name, which clung to it even after it was cleared of
its rubbish for him, for he once occupied it when a little
boy, and now it is to be his daughter’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dizzy and I pleaded for the large guest-chamber, but
Keziah said that was reserved for Dorothea who, as an
engaged young lady, was too old to sleep in a cot. And
nothing we could say was of any avail to turn her from
her purpose. The Glory Hole was good enough for
the daughter of a cook, she said, and so the room has
been emptied of its contents, and, except that it is so
small, it is quite presentable, with its matting and muslin
hangings and willow chair and table by the window,
under which there is a box of flowers, as one often sees
in London. Just where she will put her trunk or hang
her dresses I don’t know,—possibly in my closet, which
is large enough for us both. She will be here to-morrow
afternoon, and Keziah is nearly ill with dread of
her coming, and worrying as to what she will be like,
and whether she will bring a banjo, and worst of all, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>she will want to ride a bicycle! This bicycle-riding is
in Kizzy’s mind the most disreputable thing a woman
can do, and the sight of a girl on a wheel, or a boy
either, for that matter, is like a red flag to a bull,
especially since the riders have taken to the sidewalks.
She will never turn out, she declares, and I have seen
her stand like a rock and face the enemy bearing down
upon her, and once she raised her umbrella with a hiss
and a shoo, as if she were scaring chickens. I dare say
Thea will have one as soon as she lands in America,
but for Doris there are no bicycles, or banjoes, or hot
irons,—nothing but the Glory Hole. Poor little Doris!</p>

<p class='c012'>I hope she will be happy with us, and I know I am
glad because she is coming. So few have ever come
home to make me glad, and the one who could make
me the gladdest will never come again, for somewhere
in the wide world the sun is shining on his grave, I am
sure, or he would come back to me, and I should bid
him stay, or rather go with him, whether to the sands of
Arabia or to the shores of the Arctic Sea. My hair is
growing gray, the bloom has faded from my cheek, and
I shall be forty-four my next birthday, and it is
twenty-four years since I saw Tom; but a woman’s
love at forty-four is just as strong, I think, as a girl’s
at twenty, and there is scarcely a night that I do not
hear in my dreams the peculiar whistle with which he
used to summon me to our trysting-place after Kizzy
had forbidden him the house, and I see again his great,
dark eyes full of entreaty and love, and hear his voice
urging me to do what, if it were to do over again, I
would do. That is an oddly-worded sentence; but I
am too tired to change it, and will close my journal
until after I have seen Doris.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI.—<span class='sc'>Doris’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>MORTON PARK.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I have been here four weeks, and begin to feel quite
like the daughter of the house, with some exceptions.
I am in love with Aunt Beriah, very intimate with
Aunt Desire, and not as much in awe of Aunt Keziah
as I was at first. It was a lovely afternoon when the
coach from Frankfort set me down at the gate to the
Morton grounds, where a little, brown-eyed, brown-haired
lady was waiting for me. She had one of the
sweetest faces I ever saw, and one of the sweetest
voices, too, as she came towards me, holding out both
her soft white hands, and saying to me, “I am sure you
are Doris, and I am your aunt Beriah. Welcome to
Morton Park!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not so much what she said as the way she said
it, which stirred me so strangely. It was the first word
of affection I had heard from my own kin since my
mother died, and, taking her hands in mine, I kissed
them passionately, and cried like a child. I think she
cried a little, too, but am not sure. I only know that
she put her arm around my neck and said, soothingly,
“There, there, dear. Don’t cry, when I am so glad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then taking my bag and umbrella, she gave them to
a colored girl, whom she called Vine, and who, after
bobbing me a courtesy, disappeared through the gateway.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not far, and I thought you would like to walk,”
Aunt Brier said, leading the way, while I followed her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>into the park, at the rear of which stood the house, with
its white walls and Corinthian pillars, looking so cool
and pleasant in the midst of grass and flowers and
maples and elms, with an immense hawthorn-tree in
full bloom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, this is lovely, and just as papa told me it was,”
I exclaimed, and then, stopping short, Aunt Brier drew
me close to her, and scrutinizing me earnestly, said,
with a tremor in her voice, “Yes, Gerold told you of his
old home. I was so fond of him. We were like brother
and sister, and I was so sorry when he died. You are
not as much like him as I fancied you were from your
photograph.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No?” I said, interrogatively, wondering if she were
disappointed in me; but she soon set me right on that
point by saying, “Gerold was good-looking, but you
are beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I had been told that so often, and I knew it so well
without being told, that I did not feel at all elated. I
was only glad that she liked my looks, and replied,
“And you are lovely, and so young, too. My great
aunt ought to look older.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She smiled at that, and said, “I am nearly forty-four,
and feel sometimes as if I were a hundred. But
there is Kizzy on the piazza. I think we’d better hurry.
She does not like to wait for anything.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I had never really known what fear of any person
was, but I felt it now, and my heart beat violently as I
hastened my steps towards the spot where Aunt Keziah
stood, stiff and tall and straight, and looking very imposing
in her black silk gown and lace cap set on a
smooth band of false hair, a bunch of keys dangling at
her belt, and a dainty hemstitched handkerchief clasped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>in her hands. In spite of her sixty odd years, she was
a handsome woman to look at, with her shoulders
thrown back and her chin in the air as if she were on
the alert and the defensive. Her features were clearly
cut, her face smooth and pale, while her bright black
eyes seemed to look me through as they traveled rapidly
from my hat to my boots and back again, evidently
taking in every detail of my dress, and resting finally
on my face with what seemed to be disapproval.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you do, Miss Doris?” she said, with a quick
shutting together of her thin lips, and without the
shadow of a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had cried when Aunt Brier spoke to me, but I did
not want to cry now, for something of the woman’s nature
must have communicated itself to mine and frozen
me into a figure as hard and stiff as she was. It was a
trick of mine to imitate any motion or gesture which
struck me forcibly, and I involuntarily threw my shoulders
back and my chin in the air, and gave her two fingers
just as she had given me, and told her I was quite
well, and hoped she was the same. For a moment she
looked at me curiously, while it seemed to me that her
features did relax a little as she asked if I were not very
tired with the journey and the dusty ride in the coach
from Frankfort.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It always upsets me,” she said, suggesting that I go
at once to my room and rest until dinner, which would
be served sharp at six, “and,” she added, “we never
wait for meals; breakfast at half-past seven in the summer,
lunch at half-past twelve, dinner at six.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she made a stately bow, and I felt that I was
dismissed from her presence, and started to follow
Aunt Beriah into the hall just as two negroes came up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the walk bringing one of my trunks, which had been
deposited at the entrance to the park.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mass’r Hinton’s man done fotchin’ t’other trunk on
his barrer,” the taller negro said, in response to a look of
inquiry he must have seen on my face, and instantly
Aunt Kizzy’s lips came together just as they had done
when she said, “How do you do, Miss Doris?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two trunks?” she asked, in a tone which told me
that I had brought altogether too much luggage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” I replied, stopping until the negroes came up
the steps. “Perhaps I ought to have brought but one,
but I have so many books and things, and, besides, one
trunk was father’s and one mother’s, and I could not
give either up. This was father’s, which he said you
gave him when he went to college. See, here is his
name.” And I pointed to “Gerald Morton, Versailles,
Ky.,” on the end of the stout leather trunk, which had
withstood the wear of years.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I remember it,” she said, in a voice so changed
and with so different an expression on her face that I
scarcely knew her as she bent over the trunk, which she
touched caressingly with her hand. “You have kept it
well,” she continued; then, to the negroes, “Take it up-stairs,
and mind you don’t mar the wall nor the banisters.
Look sharp, now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mass’r Hinton’s man” had arrived with the wheelbarrow
and the other trunk, a huge Saratoga, with
mother’s name upon it, “Doris Morton, New Haven,
Ct.,” but this Aunt Keziah did not touch. Indeed, it
seemed to me that she recoiled from it, and there was
an added severity in her tone as she told the man to be
careful, and chided him for cutting up the gravel with
the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>“I’s couldn’t tote it, missis; it’s too heavy,” he said,
as he waited for one of the other blacks to help him
take it up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had reached the upper hall and was standing by the
door of my room, while Aunt Beriah said, apologetically,
“I am sorry it is so small: perhaps we can
change it bye-and-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was really a very pretty room, but quite too small
for my trunks unless I moved out either the bedstead,
or the bureau, or the washstand, and, as I could not
well dispense with either of these, I looked rather ruefully
at my aunt, who said, “There is a big closet in my
room where you can hang your dresses and put both
your trunks when they are unpacked.” And that was
where I did put them, but not until after two days, for
I awoke the next morning with the worst headache I
ever had in my life, and which, I suppose, was induced
by the long and rapid journey from Meadowbrook,
added to homesickness and crying myself to sleep. I
could not even sit up, and was compelled to keep my
room, where Aunt Beriah nursed me so tenderly and
lovingly, while Aunt Kizzy came three times a day to
ask how I was, and where I first saw my aunt Desire,
who had been suffering with neuralgia and was not
present at dinner on the night of my arrival. She sent
me her love, however, and the next day came into my
room, languid and graceful, with a pretty air of invalidism
about her, and a good deal of powder on her face,
reminding me of a beautiful ball-dress which has done
service through several seasons and been turned
and made over and freshened up until it looks almost
as well as new. Her dress, of some soft, cream-colored
material was artistically draped around her fine figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>and fastened on the left side with a ribbon bow of baby
blue, and her fair hair, in which there was very little
gray, was worn low on her neck in a large, flat knot,
from which a few curls were escaping and adding to her
youthful appearance. If I had not known that she was
over fifty, I might, in my darkened room, easily have
mistaken her for a young girl, and I told her so when
after kissing me and telling me who she was, she sank
into the rocking-chair and asked me if she looked at all
as I thought she would.</p>

<p class='c012'>With a merry laugh, which showed her white, even
teeth, she said, “I like that. I like to look young, if I
am fifty, which I will confess to you just because Kizzy
will be sure to tell you; otherwise, torture could not
wring it from me. A woman is as old as she feels, and
I feel about twenty-five. Nor do I think it is necessary
to blurt out my age all the time, as Kizzy does. It’s no
crime to be old, but public opinion and women themselves
have made it so. Let two of them get to saying
nasty things about a third, and they are sure to add
several years to her age, while even men call a girl right
old before she is thirty, and doesn’t that prove that
although age may be honorable it is not desirable, and
should be fought against as long as possible? And I
intend to fight it, too, and thus far have succeeded
pretty well, or should, if it were not for Kizzy, who
has the most aggravating way of saying to me, ‘You
ought not to do so at your time of life,’ and ‘at your
age,’ as if I were a hundred.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I listened to her in amazement and admiration too.
She was so pretty and graceful and earnest that although
I thought her rather silly, and wished that in
her fight against time she did not make up quite so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>much as I knew she did, I was greatly drawn towards
her, and for a while forgot my headache as she told me
of her ailments, which were legion, and with which
Aunt Kizzy had little sympathy. “Kizzy thinks all one
has to do is to exercise his will and make an effort, as
Mrs. Chick insisted poor Fanny should do in ‘Dombey
and Son,’” she said, and then went on to give me
glimpses of their family life and bits of family history,
all of which were, of course, very interesting to me.
Aunt Brier, I heard, had been engaged, when young, to
a very fine young man, but Aunt Kizzy broke up the
match because she wished Beriah to marry some one in
the Hepburn line, which was frightfully tangled up
with the Morton line.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It would take too long to explain the tangle,” she
said, “and so I shall not try. It estranged your father
from us, and his father before him, because each took
the woman of his choice in spite of the line.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she told me of her own dead love, to whose
memory she had been faithful thirty years, and who so
often visited her in her dreams that he was as much a
reality now as the day he died.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And that is why I try to keep young, for where he
has gone they know no lapse of time, and if he can see
me, as I believe he can, I do not want to look old to
him,” she said, with a pathetic sob, while her white
hands worked nervously.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she told me that I was in the Glory Hole, which
my father had so named, and told me, too, that she and
Beriah had fought for the larger room, but had given
in to Kizzy, as they always did.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe she has an invisible cat-o’-nine-tails which
makes us all afraid of her,” she added; “but, really,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>when you get down to the kernel it is good as gold, and
you can get there if you try. Don’t seem afraid of her,
or fond of her, either. She hates gush, and she hates
cowardice and deceit; but she adores manner and etiquette
as she knew it forty years ago, and dislikes everything
modern and new.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not tell me all this at one sitting, for she
came to see me twice during the two days I kept my
bed, and at each visit told me so much that I felt pretty
well informed with regard to the family history, and
began to lose my dread of Aunt Keziah and to feel less
nervous when I heard her quick step and sharp voice
in the hall. I knew she meant to be kind, and knew, too,
that she was watching me curiously and trying to make
up her mind as to what manner of creature I was, and
whether I was feigning sickness or not. As she had
never had a hard headache in her life, she did not know
how to sympathize with one who had, and at the close
of the second day she made me understand that mine
had lasted long enough and that all I required now was
an effort and fresh air, and that she should expect me
down to breakfast the next morning. And as I was
better, I made the effort, and at precisely half-past
seven followed my three aunts down the stairs in a methodical,
military kind of way, which reminded me of
the school in Meadowbrook, where we used to march to
the sound of a drum and a leader’s call of “Left, right;
left, right,” Aunt Kizzy in this case being the leader
and putting her foot down with an energy which
marked all her movements.</p>

<p class='c012'>The table was laid with great care, and Aunt Keziah
said grace with her eyes open and upon black Tom, who
was slyly purloining a lump of sugar from the bowl on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>the sideboard, and who nearly choked himself in his efforts
to swallow it in time for his Amen, which was very
audible and made me laugh in spite of my fear of Aunt
Kizzy. When breakfast was over I was invited into her
room, where I underwent a rigid cross-examination as
to what I had learned at school, as well as done and left
undone. I was also told what I could do and not do at
Morton Park. There was a new Steinway in the
drawing-room, on which I could practice each day from
nine to ten and from three to four, but at no other time
unless specially invited. Nor was I to sing unless asked
to do so, while humming to myself was out of the question,
as something very reprehensible. I was never to
cross my feet when I sat down, nor lean back in my
chair, nor put my hands upon the table, and above all
things she hoped I did not whistle, and had not acquired
a taste for banjoes and bicycles, as she heard some
young ladies had.</p>

<p class='c012'>With her sharp eyes upon me I was forced to confess
that I could whistle a little and play the banjo, and
had only been kept from buying one by lack of
means, and also that when in Meadowbrook I had tried
to ride a wheel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A Morton on a wheel and playing a banjo!” she
exclaimed, in horror. “Surely, surely, you did not inherit
this low taste from your father’s family. It is
not the Morton blood which whistles and rides on
wheels. It is your——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Something in my face must have checked her, for she
stopped suddenly and stared at me, while I said,
“Aunt Kizzy, I know you mean my mother, and I want
to tell you now that in every respect she was my
father’s equal, and was the sweetest, loveliest woman I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>ever saw, and my father was so fond of her. I know
you were angry because he married her, and you were
very unjust to her, but she never said a word against
you, and now she is dead I will hear nothing against
her. She was my mother, and I am more like her than
like the Mortons, and I am glad of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was not very respectful language, I knew, and I
half expected her to box my ears, but she did nothing
of the kind, and it seemed to me as if her expression
softened towards me as she went on asking questions
about other and different matters, and finally dismissed
me with the advice that I should lie down awhile, as I
looked pale and tired. That was four weeks ago, and
since that time I have learned to know her better, and
have found many good points which I admire. She has
never mentioned my mother to me since that day, but
has asked me many questions about my father and our
home in Meadowbrook. In most things, too, I have my
own way and am very happy, for Aunt Keziah has withdrawn
some of her restrictions. I practice now when I
like, and sing when I please, and even hum a little to
myself, and once, when she was gone, I whistled “Annie
Rooney” to my own accompaniment, with Aunts Dizzy
and Brier for audience. I have seen a good many of the
Versailles people, and have had compliments enough
on my beauty to turn any girl’s head. I have learned
every nook and corner of the house and park, and become
quite attached to my Glory Hole, which I really
prefer to the great room adjoining it, with its high-post
bedstead and canopy, and its stiff mahogany furniture,
which Aunt Kizzy says is nearly a hundred years old.</p>

<p class='c012'>It looks a thousand, as does the furniture in the next
room beyond, which puzzles me a little, it smells so like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>a man, and a young man, too. By this I mean that
there is in it a decided odor of tobacco and cigars, and
the leather-covered easy-chair looks to me as if some
man had often lounged in it, while I know there are a
smoking-jacket and a pair of men’s slippers there.</p>

<p class='c012'>Funny that such things should be in this house of the
Vestal Virgins, as I call them, and bye-and-bye I shall
get to be one, I suppose, and tend the sacred fires, and
go on errands of mercy, unless, indeed, I fall in love and
am buried alive, as were the erring Vestals of old, which
God forbid.</p>

<p class='c012'>I wish that room did not bother me as it does. I
think it is kept locked most of the time, but two days
ago I saw Rache cleaning it, and walked in, as a matter
of course, and smelled the cigars, and saw the jacket
and the slippers in the closet, and asked Rache whose
room it was. She stammers a little, and I could not
quite make out what she said; and just as I was going
to repeat my question Aunt Kizzy appeared and with a
gesture of her hand waived me from the room, which
remains to me as much a mystery as ever. I could, of
course, ask one or all of my aunts about it, but by some
intuition I seem to know that they do not care to talk
about it. Indeed, I have felt ever since I have been here
that there is something they are keeping from me, and
I believe it is connected with this room, which may
have been my father’s, or grandfather’s, or great-grandfather’s,
although the smell is very much like the cigars
of the Harvard boys, and that smoking-jacket had a
modern look. But, whatever the mystery is, I mean in
time to find it out.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Doris is here, and has been for four weeks, and in
spite of myself I am drawn to her more and more every
day. I did not want her to come, and I meant to be
cold and distant to her, but when she looked at me with
something in her blue eyes like Gerold, I began to
soften, while the sight of Gerold’s trunk unnerved me
wholly. I gave it to him when he first went away to
college, and I remember so well how pleased he was,
and how he put his arms around me and kissed me, as
he thanked me for it, and said, “Auntie, the trunk is so
big that I shall not bring it home at my vacations, but
leave it in New Haven. So when you see it again it
will be full of honors, and I shall be an A. B., of whom
you will be so proud.”</p>

<p class='c012'>God forgive me if I have done wrong; that was
twenty-five years ago, and Gerold is dead, and his trunk
was brought back to me by his daughter, whose face is
not his face, although very, very beautiful. I acknowledge
that to myself, and rebel against it a little, as I
mentally contrast it with Dorothea’s and wonder what
Grant will think of it. I have surely done well to keep
him from all knowledge of her until he was engaged to
Dorothea, and even now I tremble a little for the result
when he is thrown in contact with her every day, for
aside from her wonderful beauty there is a grace and
charm about her that Dorothea lacks, and had I seen
her before she came here I should have kept her at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>North until after Grant’s marriage, which I mean shall
take place as early as Christmas.</p>

<p class='c012'>He is coming home sooner than I expected; indeed
he sails in two or three days, and I must tell her at
once that she has a cousin, and in some way put her on
her honor not to try to attract him. It is a difficult thing
to do, for the girl has a spirit of her own, and there is
sometimes a flash in her eyes which I do not like to
meet. I saw it first when I said something derogatory
of her mother. How her eyes blazed, and how grand
she was in her defense, and how I respected her for it!</p>

<p class='c012'>Ah me, that Hepburn lease! What mischief it has
wrought, and how the ghosts of the past haunt me at
times, when I remember the stand I have taken to save
our house from ruin! Beriah says I am a monomaniac
on the subject, and also that she doubts the validity of
the lease. But that does not matter. My father bade
me respect Amos Hepburn’s wishes, and I shall, to the
letter, if Grant does not marry Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>I must stop now and superintend the opening of a
box which by some mistake Grant left at Cambridge and
did not think necessary to have forwarded to us until
recently, when he gave orders to have it sent us by
express, It has in it a little of everything, he wrote,
and among the rest a picture which he thinks will interest
and puzzle us as it has him. I hear Tom hammering
at the box, and must go and see to it.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.—<span class='sc'>Doris’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>MY COUSIN GRANTLEY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I have solved the mystery of that room with the
smell of cigars and the smoking-jacket. It does belong
to a man, and that man is Grantley Montague, and
Grantley Montague is my second cousin. Aunt Kizzy
told me all about him this morning, and I am still so
dazed and bewildered and glad and indignant that I can
scarcely write connectedly about it. Why was the
knowledge that Grant was my cousin kept from me so
long, and from him, too, as he is still as ignorant as I
was a few hours ago? Aunt Kizzy’s explanation was
very lame. She said if he had known that he had a
cousin at Wellesley when he was in Harvard, nothing
could have kept him from seeing me so often that we
should both have been interrupted in our studies,—that
she did not approve of students visiting the girls while
they were in school,—and that she hardly knew why
she did not tell me as soon as I came here. This was
not very satisfactory, and I believe there is something
behind; but when I appealed to Aunts Dizzy and
Beriah, and said I was hurt and angry, Aunt Brier did
not answer at all, but Aunt Dizzy said, “I don’t blame
you, and I’d have told you long ago if I had not been
so afraid of Kizzy;” and that is all I could get from
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>But I know now that Grant is my cousin; and this is
how it happened. This morning, as I was crossing the
back piazza, I saw Tom opening a box which had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>by express and which Aunt Kizzy was superintending.
Taking a seat on the side piazza, I thought no more
about it until I heard Aunt Kizzy say, very hurriedly
and excitedly, “Go, boy, and call Miss Desire and Miss
Beriah,—quick,” and a moment after I heard them both
exclaim, and caught the sound of my father’s name, Gerold.
Then I arose, and, going around the corner, saw
them bending over a picture which I recognized at once,
and in a moment I was kneeling by it and kissing it as I
would have kissed my father’s hand had it suddenly
been reached to me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, the picture!” I cried. “It is my father’s; he
painted it. I saw him do it. He said it was a picture
of his aunties, and this is himself. Dear father!”
And I touched the face of the young man who was
standing behind the woman with the baby in her lap.</p>

<p class='c012'>Aunt Kizzy was very white, and her voice shook as
she asked me to explain, which I did rapidly and clearly,
telling all I knew of the picture, which had been sold
to some gentleman from Boston for fifty dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And,” I added, “that fifty dollars went to pay his
funeral expenses, poor dear father. He was ill so
long, and we were so poor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was crying, and in fact we were all crying together,
Aunt Kizzy the hardest of all, so that the hemstitched
handkerchief she always carried so gingerly was quite
moist and limp. I was the first to recover myself, and
asked:</p>

<p class='c012'>“How did it get here? Whose box is this?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our nephew’s, Grantley Montague, who was graduated
at Harvard last year and is now in Europe. He
left this box in Cambridge by mistake, and it was not
sent to us until yesterday. We are expecting him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>home in a short time. He must have bought the picture
for its resemblance to us, although he could not
have known that it was painted for us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Aunt Kizzy who told me this very rapidly, as
if anxious to get it off her mind, and I noticed that she
did not look at me as she spoke, and that she seemed
embarrassed and anxious to avoid my gaze.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Grantley Montague,—your nephew! Then he is
my cousin!” I exclaimed, while every particular connected
with the young man came back to me, and none
more distinctly than the telegram, No, sent in response
to my request that I might attend his tea-party.</p>

<p class='c012'>I know that my eyes were flashing as they confronted
Aunt Kizzy, who stammered out:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your second cousin,—yes. Did you happen to see
him while at Wellesley?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was trying to be very cool, but I was terribly excited,
and, losing all fear of her, replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“No; you took good care that I should meet no Harvard
boys; but I saw Grantley Montague once on the
train, and I heard so much about him, but I never
dreamed he was my cousin. If I had, nothing would
have kept me from him. Did he know I was there?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He knows nothing of you whatever,” Aunt Kizzy
said. “I did not think it best he should as it might
have interfered with the studies of you both. He is
coming soon, and you will of course make his acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was sitting upon the box and crying bitterly, not
only for the humiliation and injustice done to me, but
from a sense of all I had lost by not knowing that
Grantley was my cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, when she asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>why I cried. “It would have made me so happy, and I
have been so lonely at times, with no one of my own
blood to care for me, and I should have been so proud
of him; and when he invited me to his party, why
didn’t you let me go? I did everything to please you.
You did nothing to please me!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I must have been hysterical, for my voice sounded
very loud and unnatural as I reproached her, while she
tried to soothe me and explain. But I would not be
soothed, and kept on crying until I could cry no longer,
and still, in the midst of my pain, I was conscious of a
great joy welling up in my heart, as I reflected that
Grantley was my cousin, and that I should soon see him
in spite of Aunt Kizzy, who, I think, was really sorry
for me and did not resent what I said to her. She had
me in her room for an hour after lunch, and tried to
smooth the matter over.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are very pretty,” she said, “and Grant is very
susceptible to a pretty face, and if he had seen yours he
might have paid you attentions which would have
turned your head, and perhaps have done you harm
as they would have meant nothing. They couldn’t
mean anything; they must mean nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was getting more and more excited, and began
to walk the floor as she went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I may as well tell you that I dread his coming. He
is very magnetic,—with something about him which
attracts every one. Your father had it, and your grandfather
before him, and Grant has it, and you will be influenced
by it, but it must not be. Oh, why did I let
you come here, with your fatal beauty, which is sure to
work us evil? or, having come, why are you not in the
Hepburn line?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>I thought she had gone crazy, and stared at her wonderingly
as she continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t explain now what I mean, except that Grant
<em>must</em> marry money, and you have none. You have only
your beauty, which is sure to impress him, but it must
not be. Promise me, Doris, to be discreet, and not try
to attract him,—not try to win his love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aunt Keziah! What do you take me for!” I exclaimed,
indignantly, and she replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forgive me; I hardly know what I am saying;
only it must not be. You must not mar my scheme,
though if you were in the line, I’d accept you so gladly
as Grantley’s wife.” And then, to my utter amazement,
she stooped and  kissed me, for the first time since I had
known her.</p>

<p class='c012'>A great deal more she said to me, and when the interview
was over, there was on my mind a confused impression
that I was not to interfere with her plan of
marrying Grantley to a rich wife,—Dorothea Haynes,
probably, although no mention was made of her,—and
also that I was to treat him very coldly and not in any
way try to attract him. The idea was so ludicrous that
after a little it rather amused than displeased me, but
did not in the least lessen my desire to see the young
man who had been the lion at Harvard, and whom I
had seen in the car whistling an accompaniment to
Dorothea’s banjo.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have told Aunts Desire and Beriah of that incident,
and of nearly all I had heard with regard to Grantley
and Dorothea, but the only comment they made was
that they had known Miss Haynes since she was a child,
that she had visited at Morton Park, and would probably
come there again in the autumn. Once I thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>to ask if she were engaged to Grantley, but the wall of
reserve which they manage to throw about them when
the occasion requires it, kept me silent, and I can only
speculate upon it and anticipate the time when I shall
stand face to face with Grantley Montague.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.—<span class='sc'>The Author’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>GRANTLEY AND DORIS.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was one of those lovely summer days, neither too
hot nor too cold, which sometimes occur in Kentucky
even in August. The grounds at Morton Park were
looking their best, for there had been a heavy shower
the previous night, and since sunrise three negroes had
been busy mowing and rolling and pruning and weeding
until there was scarcely a twig or dead leaf to be
seen upon the velvet lawn, while the air was sweet with
the odor of the flowers in the beds and on the broad
borders. Mas’r Grantley was expected home on the
morrow, and that was incentive enough for the blacks
to do their best, for the negroes worshiped their young
master, who, while maintaining a proper dignity of
manner, was always kind and considerate and even
familiar with them to a certain extent. Within doors
everything was also ready for the young man. Keziah
had indulged in a new cap, Dizzy in a pretty tea-gown,
while Beriah had spent her surplus money for a new fur
rug for Grant’s room, which had been made very bright
and attractive with the decorations which had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>with the picture in the box from Cambridge. As for
Doris, she had nothing new, nor did she need anything,
and she made a very pretty picture in her simple muslin
dress and big garden-hat, when about four o’clock she
took a book and sauntered down to a summer-house in
the rear of the grounds, near the little gate which
opened upon the turnpike and was seldom used except
when some one of the family wished to go out that way
to call upon a neighbor or meet the stage.</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking a seat in the arbor, Doris was soon so absorbed
in her book as not to hear the stage from Frankfort
when it stopped at the gate, or to see the tall young
man with satchel in one hand and light walking-cane
in the other who came up the walk at a rapid rate and
quickened his steps when he caught a glimpse of a light
dress among the green of the summer-house. Grantley,
who had been spending a little time with Dorothea at
Wilmot Terrace, which was a mile or more out of Cincinnati,
had not intended to come home until the next
day, but there had suddenly come over him an intense
longing to see his aunts and the old place, which he
could not resist, while, to say the truth, he was getting
a little tired of constant companionship with Dorothea
and wished to get away from her and rest. It was all
very well, he said to himself, to be kissed and caressed
and made much of by a nice girl for a while, but there
was such a thing as too much of it, and a fellow would
rather do some of the love-making himself. Dorothea
was all right, of course, and he liked her better than
any girl he had ever seen, although she was not his
ideal, which he should never find. He had given that
up, and the Lost Star did not now flit across his memory
as often as formerly, although he had not forgotten her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and still saw at times the face which had shone upon
him for a brief moment and then been lost, as he
believed, forever. He was not, however, thinking of it
now, when, wishing to surprise his aunts, he dismounted
from the stage at the gate and came hurrying up the
walk,—the short cut to the house. Catching sight of
Doris’s dress, and thinking it was his aunt Desire, he
called out in his loud, cheery voice, “Hello, Aunt
Dizzy! You look just like a young girl in that blue
gown and big hat with poppies on it. Are you glad to
see me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>In an instant Doris was on her feet and confronting
him with the bright color staining her cheeks and a
kindling light in her blue eyes as she went forward to
meet him. She knew who it was, and, with a bright
smile which made his heart beat rapidly, she offered
him her hand and said, “I am not your aunt Dizzy, but
if you are Grantley Montague I am your cousin, Doris
Morton,—Gerald Morton’s daughter,—and I am very
glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For the first time in his life Grantley’s speech forsook
him. Here was his Lost Star, declaring herself to be
his cousin! What did it mean? Dropping his satchel
and taking off his soft hat, with which he fanned himself
furiously, he exclaimed, “Great Scott! My cousin
Doris! Gerold Morton’s daughter! I don’t understand
you. I never knew he had a daughter, or much
about him any way. Where have you kept yourself,
that I have never seen or heard of you, and why
haven’t my aunts told me of you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He had her hand in his, as he led her back to the
summer-house, while she said to him. “A part of the
time I have been at Wellesley. I was there when you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>were at Harvard, and used to hear a great deal of you,
although I never dreamed you were my cousin till I
came here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This took his breath away, and, sitting down beside
her, he plied her with questions until he knew all that
she knew of her past and why they had been kept apart
so long.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By Jove, I don’t like it,” he said. “Why, if I had
known you were at Wellesley I should have spent half
my time on the road between there and Harvard——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the other half between Harvard and Madame
De Moisiere’s?” Doris said, archly, as she moved a little
from him, for he had a hand on her shoulder now.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean?” he asked, quickly, while
something of the light faded from his eyes, and the
eagerness from his voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I heard a great deal about you from different
sources, and about Miss Haynes, too; and I once saw
you with her in the train whistling an accompaniment
to her banjo,” Doris replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The dickens you did!” Grant said, dropping Doris’s
hand, which he had held so closely.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a strange thing to say of an engaged young man
that the mention of his betrothed was like a breath of
cold wind chilling him suddenly, but it was so in Grant’s
case. With the Lost Star sitting by him, he had for a
moment forgotten Dorothea, whose farewell kiss was
only a few hours old.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The dickens you did! Well, I suppose you thought
me an idiot; but what did you think of Dorothea?” he
asked, and Doris replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought her very nice, and wished I might know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>her, for I felt sure I should like her. And she is coming
to Morton Park in the autumn. Aunt Brier told me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I believe she is to visit us then,” Grant said,
without a great deal of enthusiasm, and then, changing
the conversation, he began to ask about his aunts, and
what Doris thought of them, and if she were happy with
them, and when she first heard he was her cousin, and
how.</p>

<p class='c012'>She told him of the box and the picture which had led
to the disclosure, and which she had recognized at once.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And your father was the artist!” he exclaimed.
“By Jove, that’s funny! How things come round!
I found it in a dealer’s shop and bought it because it
looked so much like my aunts, although I did not really
suppose they were the originals, as I never remembered
them as they are on the canvas. And that moon-faced
baby was meant for me, was it? What did you think
of him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t think him very interesting,” Doris replied;
and then they both laughed, and said the pleasant
nothings which two young people who are pleased with
each other are apt to say, and on the strength of their
cousinship became so confidential and familiar that at
the end of half an hour Doris felt that she had known
Grant all her life, while he could scarcely have told how
he did feel.</p>

<p class='c012'>Doris’s beauty, freshness, and vivacity, so different
from what he had been accustomed to in the class of
girls he had known, charmed and intoxicated him,
while the fact that she was his cousin and the Lost Star
bewildered and confused him; and added to this was a
feeling of indignation that he had so long been kept in
ignorance of her existence.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“I don’t like it in Aunt Kizzy, and I mean to tell her
so,” he said, at last, as he rose to his feet, and, picking
up his satchel, went striding up the walk towards the
house, with Doris at his side.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was now nearly six o’clock, and Aunt Kizzy was
adjusting her cap and giving sundry other touches to
her toilet preparatory to dinner, when, glancing from
her window, she saw the young couple as they emerged
from a side path, Doris with her sun-hat in her hand
and her hair blowing about her glowing face, which was
lifted towards Grant, who was looking down at her and
talking rapidly. Miss Kizzy knew Doris was pretty,
but never had the girl’s beauty struck her as it did now,
when she saw her with Grant and felt an indefinable
foreboding that the Hepburn line was in danger.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Doris is a flirt, and Grant is no better, and I’ll send
for Dorothea at once. There is no need to wait until
autumn,” she said to herself, as she went down stairs
and out upon the piazza, where Beriah and Desire were
already, for both had seen him from the parlor and had
hurried out to meet him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello, hello, hello,” he said to each of the three
aunts, as he kissed them affectionately. “I know you
didn’t expect me,” he continued, as, with the trio clinging
to him and making much of him, he went into the
house,—“I know you didn’t expect me so soon, but the
fact is I was homesick and wished to see you all and so
I came. I hope you are glad. And, I say, why in the
name of all that is good didn’t you ever tell me I had a
cousin,—and at Wellesley, too? And why did you never
tell me more of Cousin Gerold, who, it seems, painted that
picture of you all? It’s awfully queer. Hello, Tom, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>d’ye?” he added, as a woolly head appeared in the doorway
and a grinning negro answered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Jes’ tol’able, thanky, Mas’r Grant. How d’ye youself?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Keziah was evidently very glad of this diversion,
which turned the conversation away from Doris, who
had remained outside, with a feeling that for the present
the aunts must have Grant to themselves. How
handsome and bright and magnetic he was, and how
gay he made the dinner with his jokes and merry
laugh! Once, however, it seemed to Doris that a
shadow flitted across his face, and that was when Miss
Keziah asked after Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, she’s right well,” he answered, indifferently,
and when his aunt continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Didn’t she hate to have you leave so abruptly?” he
replied, laughingly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“She paid me the compliment of saying so, but I
reckon Aleck Grady will console her for awhile.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is Aleck Grady?” Miss Morton asked, and
Grant replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have I never written you about Aleck Grady? A
good fellow enough, but an awful bore, and a second
cousin of Thea’s, who joined us in Egypt and has been
with us ever since.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Beriah had heard of him, but Miss Morton could not
recall him, and continued to ask questions about him as
if she scented danger from him as well as from Doris.
Was he in the Hepburn line and really Thea’s cousin,
and did she like him?</p>

<p class='c012'>At the mention of the Hepburn line Grant’s face
clouded, and he answered rather stiffly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“He <em>is</em> in the Hepburn line, one degree removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>from Thea, and he is hunting for a missing link, which,
if found, will knock Thea into a cocked hat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Morton knew about the missing link herself;
indeed, she had once tried to trace it, but had given it up
with the conviction that it was extinct, and if she
thought so, why, then, it was so, and Aleck Grady would
never find it. But he might be dangerous elsewhere,
and she repeated her question as to whether Thea liked
him or not.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I dare say,—as her cousin,” Grant replied, adding,
with a view to tease his aunt, “and she may get up a
warmer feeling, for there is no guessing what will happen
when a young man is teaching a girl to ride a
bicycle, as he is teaching Thea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ride a bicycle! Thea on a bicycle! Thea astride
of a wheel!” Miss Morton exclaimed, horrified and
aghast at the idea.</p>

<p class='c012'>Was the world all topsy-turvy, or had she lived so
long out of it that she had lost her balance and fallen
off? She did not know, and she looked very white and
worried, while Grant laughed at her distress and told
her how picturesque Thea looked in her blue gown and
red shoes and jockey cap, adding:</p>

<p class='c012'>“And she rides well, too, which is more than can be
said of all the girls. But it is of no use to kick at the
bicycles; they have come to stay, and I mean to get
Doris one as soon as I can. She must not be left out in
the cold when Thea and I go racing down the turnpike.
She will be splendid on a wheel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“God forbid!” came with a gasp from the highly
scandalized lady, while Doris’s eyes shone with a wonderful
brilliancy as they looked their thanks at Grant.</p>

<p class='c012'>With a view to change the conversation, Beriah began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>to question Grant of his trip to Egypt, without a suspicion
of the deep waters into which she was sailing.
After describing some of the excursions on the donkeys,
Grant suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the way, Aunt Brier, I met an old acquaintance
of yours in Cairo, Tom Atkins, who said he used to visit
Morton Park. Do you remember him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Beriah was white to the roots of her hair, and her
hand shook so that her coffee was spilled upon the damask
cloth as she answered, faintly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tom Atkins? yes, I remember him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Keziah who came to the rescue now by giving
the signal to leave the table, and so put an end for the
time being to the conversation concerning Tom Atkins;
but that evening, after most of the family had retired,
as Grant sat smoking in the moonlight at the end of the
piazza, a slender figure clad in a gray wrapper with a
white scarf on her head stole up to him and said, very
softly and sadly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, Grant, tell me about Tom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Grant told her all he knew, and that night Beriah
wrote in her diary as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tom is alive, and wears a fez and a white flannel
suit, and has a little, dark-eyed, tawny-haired girl whom
he calls Zaidee. Of course there is or has been an
Oriental wife, and Tom is as much lost to me as if he
were sleeping in his grave. I am glad he is alive, and
think I am glad because of the little girl Zaidee. It is
a pretty name, and if she were motherless I know I
could love her dearly for Tom’s sake, but such happiness
is not for me. Ah, well, God knows best.”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER X.—<span class='sc'>Doris’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>THEA AT MORTON PARK.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Thea is here, and has brought her wheel and her
banjo and her pet dog, besides three trunks of clothes.
The dog, whom she calls Cheek, has conceived an unaccountable
dislike to Aunt Kizzy, at whom he barks so
furiously whenever she is in sight that Thea keeps him
tied in her room except when she takes him into the
grounds for exercise. Even then he is on the lookout
for the enemy, and once made a fierce charge at her
shawl, which she had left in the summer-house and
which was not rescued from him until one or two rents
had been made in it. Thea laughs, and calls him a bad
boy, and puts her arms around Aunt Kizzy’s neck and
kisses her and tells her she will send Cheek home as
soon as she gets a chance, and then she sings “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,”
which she says is all the rage, and she
dances the skirt dance with Grant, to whom she is teaching
a new step, which shows her pretty feet and ankles
and consists mostly of “one-two-three-kick.” And they
do kick, or Grant does, so high that Aunt Kizzy asks in
alarm if that is quite proper, and then Thea kisses her
again and calls her “an unsophisticated old darling who
doesn’t know the ways of the world and must be taught.”
Her banjo lies round anywhere and everywhere, just as
do her hat and her gloves and parasol, and Aunt Kizzy,
who is so particular with me, never says a word, but
herself picks up after the disorderly girl, who, with
Grant, has turned the house upside down and filled it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>with laughter and frolic. Her wheel stays at night in a
little room at the end of the piazza, with Grant’s, for he
has one, and with Thea he goes scurrying through the
town, sometimes in the street and sometimes on the
sidewalk, to the terror of the pedestrians. Thea has
already knocked down two negroes and run into the stall
of an old apple-woman, who would have brought a suit
if Aunt Kizzy had not paid the damages claimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>What do I think of Thea? I love her, and have loved
her from the moment she came up to me so cordially
and called me Cousin Doris, and told me Grant had
written her all about me, and that because I was at
Morton Park she had come earlier than she had intended
doing, and had left her old Gardy and Aleck Grady disconsolate.
“But,” she added, quickly: “Aleck is coming
soon, and then it will be jolly with four of us, Grant
and you, Aleck and me, and if we can’t paint the town
red my name is not Thea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I don’t suppose she is really pretty, except her eyes,
which are lovely, but her voice is so sweet and her manners
so soft and kittenish and pleasing that you never
stop to think if she is handsome, but take her as she is
and find her charming. She occupies the guest-room
of course, and I share it with her, for she insisted at
once that my cot be moved in there, so we could “talk
nights as late as we pleased.” Aunt Kizzy, who does
not believe in talking late, and always knocks on the
wall if she hears me move in the Glory Hole after half-past
nine, objected at first, saying it was more proper
for young girls to room alone, but Thea told her that
propriety had gone out of fashion with a lot of other
stuff, and insisted, until the Glory Hole was abandoned
and used only for toilet-purposes.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“Just what it was intended for,” Thea said, “and the
idea of penning you up there is ridiculous. I know
Aunt Kizzy, as I always call her, and know exactly how
to manage her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And she does manage her beautifully, while I look on
amazed. The first night after her arrival she invited
me into her room, where I found her habited in a crimson
dressing-gown, with her hair, which had grown very
long, rippling down her back, and a silver-mounted
brush in one hand and a hand-glass in the other. There
was a light-wood fire on the hearth, for it was raining
heavily, and the house was damp and chilly. Drawing
a settee rocker before the fire, she made me sit down
close by her, and, putting her arm around me and laying
my head on her shoulder, she said, “Now, Chickie,—or
rather Softie, which suits you better, as you seem just
like the kind of girls who are softies,—now let’s talk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” I objected, “Aunt Kizzy’s room is just below,
and it’s nearly ten o’clock, and she will hear us and rap.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let her rap! I am not afraid of Aunt Kizzy. She
never raps me; and if you are so awfully particular,
we’ll whisper, while I tell you all my secrets, and you
tell me yours,—about the boys, I mean. Girls don’t
count. Tell me of the fellows, and the scrapes you got
into at school.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was in vain that I protested that I had no secrets
and knew nothing about fellows or scrapes. She knew
better, she said, for no girl could go through any school
and not know something about them unless she were a
greater softie than I looked to be.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was always getting into a scrape, or out of one,”
she said, “and it was such fun. Why, I never learned
a blessed thing,—I didn’t go to learn, and I kept the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>teachers so stirred up that their lives were a burden to
them, and I know they must have made a special thank-offering
to some missionary fund when I left. And yet
I know they liked me in spite of my pranks. And to
think you were stuffing your head with knowledge at
Wellesley all the time, and I never knew it, nor Grant
either! I tell you he don’t like it any better than I do.
And Aunt Kizzy’s excuse, that you would have
neglected your studies if you had known he was at
Harvard, is all rubbish. That was not the reason. Do
you know what the real one was?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I said I did not, and with a little laugh she continued,
“You <em>are</em> a softie, sure enough;” then, pushing me a
little from her, she regarded me attentively a moment,
and continued, “Do you know how very, very beautiful
you are?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I might have disclaimed such knowledge, if something
in her bright, searching eyes had not wrung the
truth in part from me, and made me answer, “I have
been told so a few times.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course you have,” she replied. “Who told you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, the girls at Wellesley,” I answered, beginning
to feel uneasy under the fire of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Humbug!” she exclaimed. “I tell you, girls don’t
count. I mean boys. What boy has told you you were
handsome? Has Grant? Honor bright, has Grant?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The question was so sudden that I was taken quite
aback, while conscious guilt, if I can call it that, added
to my embarrassment. It was three weeks since Grant
came home, and in that time we had made rapid strides
towards something warmer than friendship. We had
ridden and driven together for miles around the country,
had played and sung together, and walked together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>through the spacious grounds, and once when we sat in
the summer-house and I had told him of my father’s
and mother’s death and my life in Meadowbrook and
Wellesley, and how lonely I had sometimes been because
no one cared for me, he had put his arm around
me, and, kissing my forehead, had said, “Poor little
Dorey! I wish I had known you were at Wellesley.
You should never have been lonely;” and then he told
me that he had seen me twice in Boston, once at a concert
and once in a street-car, and had never forgotten
my face, which he thought beautiful, and that he had
called me his Lost Star, whom he had looked for so long
and found at last. And as he talked I had listened with
a heart so full of happiness that I could not speak,
although with the happiness there was a pang of remorse
when I remembered what Aunt Keziah had said
about my not trying to win Grant’s love. And I was
not trying; the fault, if there were any, was on his side,
and probably he meant nothing. At all events, the
scene in the summer-house was not repeated, and I
fancied that Grant’s manner after it was somewhat constrained,
as if he were a little sorry. But he had kissed
me and told me I was beautiful, and when Thea put the
question to me direct, I stammered out at last, “Ye-es,
Grant thinks I am handsome.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course he does. How can he help it? And I
don’t mind, even if we are engaged.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Engaged!” I repeated, and drew back from her a
little, for, although I had suspected the engagement, I
had never been able to draw from my aunts any allusion
to it or admission of it, and I had almost made myself
believe that there was none.</p>

<p class='c012'>But I knew it now, and for a moment I felt as if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>were smothering, while Thea regarded me curiously, but
with no jealousy or anger in her gaze.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are surprised,” she said at last. “Has neither
of the aunts told you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” I replied, “they have not, but I have sometimes
suspected it. And I have reason to think that
such a marriage would please Aunt Kizzy very much.
Let me congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You needn’t,” she said, a little stiffly. “It is all a
made-up affair. Shall I tell you about myself?” And,
drawing me close to her again, she told me that at a
very early age she became an orphan, with a large fortune
as a certainty when she was twenty-one, as she
would be at Christmas, and another fortune coming to
her in the spring, if she did not marry Grant, and half
in case she did. “It’s an awful muddle,” she continued,
“and you can’t understand it. I don’t either, except
that one of my ancestors, old Amos Hepburn, of Keswick,
England, made a queer will, or condition, or
something, by which the Mortons will lose their home
unless I marry Grant, which is not a bad thing to do.
I have known him all my life, and like him so much;
and it is not a bad thing for him to marry me, either.
Better do that than lose his home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would he marry you just for money?” I asked,
while the spot on my forehead, which he had kissed,
burned so that I thought she must see it.</p>

<p class='c012'>But she was brushing her long hair and twisting it
into braids, and did not look at me as she went on
rapidly: “No, I don’t think he would marry me for my
money unless he liked me some. Aleck wouldn’t, and
Grant thinks himself vastly superior to Aleck, whom he
calls a bore and a crank; and perhaps he is, but he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>very nice,—not handsome like Grant, and not like him
in anything. He has reddish hair, and freckles on his
nose, and big hands, and wears awful baggy clothes,
and scolds me a good deal, which Grant never does, and
tells me I am fast and slangy, and that I powder too
much. He is my second cousin, you know, and stands
next to me in the Hepburn line, and if I should die he
would come in for the Morton estate, unless he finds
the missing link, as he calls it, which is ahead of us
both. I am sure you will like him, and I shall be so
glad when he comes. I am not half as silly with him
as I am without him, because I am a little afraid of him,
and I miss him so much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As I knew nothing of Aleck, I did not reply, and
after a moment, during which she finished braiding her
hair and began to do up her bangs in curl-papers, she
said, abruptly, “Why don’t you speak? Don’t you
tumble?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What <em>do</em> you mean?” I asked, and with very expressive
gestures of her hands, which she had learned
abroad, she exclaimed, “Now, you are not so big a
softie as not to know what <em>tumble</em> means, and you have
been graduated at Wellesley, too! You are greener
than I thought, and I give it up. But you just wait
till I have coached you awhile, and you’ll know what
tumble means, and a good many more things of which
you never dreamed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I said I did not like slang,—in short, that I detested
it,—and we were having rather a spirited discussion on
the subject, and Thea was talking in anything but a
whisper, when suddenly there came a tremendous knock
on the door, which in response to Thea’s prompt
“<i><span lang="fr">Entrez</span></i>” opened wide and disclosed to view the awful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>presence of Aunt Kizzy in her night-cap, without her
false piece, felt slippers on her feet, a candle in her
hand, and a look of stern disapproval on her face as she
addressed herself to me, asking if I knew how late it
was, and why I was keeping Thea up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is not keeping me up. I am keeping her. I
asked her to come in here, and when she said we should
disturb you I told her we would whisper, and we have
until I was stupid enough to forget myself. I’m
awfully sorry, but Doris is not to blame,” Thea explained,
generously defending me against Aunt Kizzy,
towards whom she moved with a graceful, gliding step,
adding, as she put her arm around her neck, “Now go
back to bed, that’s a dear, and Doris shall go too, and
we’ll never disturb you again. I wonder if you know
how funny you look without your hair!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I had never suspected Aunt Kizzy of caring much
for her personal appearance, but at the mention of her
hair she quickly put her hand to her head with a deprecatory
look on her face, and without another word
walked away, while Thea threw herself into a chair,
shaking with laughter and declaring that it was a lark
worthy of De Moisiere.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c012'>Four weeks have passed since I made my last entry in
my journal, and so much has happened in that time
that I feel as if I were years older than I was when
Thea came, and, as she expressed it, “took me in hand.”
I am certainly a great deal wiser than I was, but am
neither the better nor the happier for it, and although
I know now what <em>tumble</em> means, and all the flirtation
signs, and a great deal more besides, I detest it all, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>cannot help feeling that the girl who practices such
things has lost something from her womanhood which
good men prize. Old-maidish Thea calls me, and says
I shall never be anything but a <em>softie</em>. And still we are
great friends, for no one can help loving her, she is so
bright and gay and kind. As for Grant, he puzzles me.
I have tried to be distant towards him since Thea told
me of her engagement, and once I spoke of it to him
and asked why he did not tell me himself. I never
knew before that Grant could scowl, as he did when he
replied, “Oh, bother! there are some things a fellow
does not care to talk about, and this is one of them.
You and Thea gossip together quite too much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After that I didn’t speak to Grant for two whole days.
But he made it up the third day in the summer-house
where he had kissed me once, and would have kissed
me again, but for an accident.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Doris,” he said, as he took my face between his
hands and bent his own so close to it that I felt his
breath on my cheek,—“Doris, don’t quarrel with me.
I can’t bear it. I——”</p>

<p class='c012'>What more he would have said I do not know, as
just then we heard Thea’s voice near by calling to Aleck
Grady, who has been in town three weeks, stopping at
the hotel, but spending most of his time at Morton
Park, and I like him very much. He seems very plain-looking
at first, but after you know him you forget his
hair and his freckles and his hands and general awkwardness,
and think only how thoroughly good-natured
and kind and considerate he is, with a heap of common
sense. Thea is not quite the same when he is with us.
She is more quiet and lady-like, and does not use so
much slang, and acts rather queer, it seems to me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Indeed, the three of them act queer, and I feel queer
and unhappy, although I seem to be so gay, and the
house and grounds resound with laughter and merriment
all day long. Aleck comes early, and always
stays to lunch, if invited, as he often is by Thea, but
never by Aunt Kizzy, who has grown haggard and thin
and finds a great deal of fault with me because, as she
says, I am flirting with Grant and trying to win him
from Thea.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is false. I am not flirting with Grant. I am not
trying to win him from Thea, but rather to keep out of
his way, which I cannot do, for he is always at my side,
and when we go for a walk, or a ride, or a drive, it is
Aleck and Thea first, and necessarily Grant is left for
me, and, what is very strange, he seems to like it, while
I——Oh, whither am I drifting, and what shall I do?
I know now all about the Morton lease and the Hepburn
line, for Aunt Kizzy has told me, and with tears
streaming down her cheeks has begged me not to be
her ruin. And I will not, even if I should love Grant
far more than I do now, and should feel surer than I
do that he loves me and would gladly be free from
Thea, who laughs and sings and dances as gayly as if
there were no troubled hearts around her, while Aleck
watches her and Grant and me with a quizzical look on
his face which makes me furious at times. He has
talked to me about the missing link and the family
tree, which he offered to show me, but I declined, and
said impatiently that I had heard enough about old
Amos Hepburn and that wretched condition, and wished
both had been in the bottom of the sea before they had
done so much mischief. With a good-humored laugh
he put up his family tree and told me not to be so hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>on his poor old ancestor, saying he did not think either
he or his condition would harm the Mortons much.</p>

<p class='c012'>I don’t know what he meant, and I don’t know anything
except that I am miserable, and Grant is equally
so, and I do not dare stay alone with him a moment, or
look in his eyes for fear of what I may see there, or he
may see in mine.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alas for us both, and alas for the Hepburn line!</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI.—<span class='sc'>The Author’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>THE CRISIS.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It came sooner than the two who were watching the
progress of affairs expected it, and the two were Kizzy
and Dizzy. The first was looking at what she could not
help, with a feeling like death in her heart, while the
latter felt her youth come back to her as she saw one by
one the signs she had once known so well. She knew
what Grant’s failure to marry Thea meant to them.
But she did not worry about it. With all her fear of
Keziah, she had a great respect for and confidence in
her, and was sure she would manage somehow, no matter
whom Grant married. And so in her white gown
and blue ribbons she sat upon the wide piazza day after
day, and smiled upon the young people, who, recognizing
an ally in her, made her a sort of queen around
whose throne they gathered, all longing to tell her
their secret, except Doris, who, hearing so often from
her Aunt Keziah that she was the cause of all the
trouble, was very unhappy, and kept away from Grant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>as much as possible. But he found her one afternoon
in the summer-house looking so inexpressibly sweet,
and pathetic, too, with the traces of tears on her face,
that, without a thought of the consequences, he sat
down beside her, and, putting his arms around her,
said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“My poor little darling, what is the matter, and why
do you try to avoid me as you do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was nothing of the coquette about Doris, and
at the sound of Grant’s voice speaking to her as he did,
and the touch of his hand which had taken hers and was
carrying it to his lips, she laid her head on his shoulder
and sobbed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Grant, I can’t bear it. Aunt Kizzy scolds me
so, and I—I can’t help it, and I’m going to Meadowbrook
to teach or do something, where I shall not
trouble any one again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Doris,” Grant said, in a voice more earnest and
decided than any she had ever heard from him. “You
are not going away from <em>me</em>. You are mine and I intend
to keep you. I will play a hypocrite’s part no
longer. I love <em>you</em>, and I do not love Thea as a man
ought to love the girl he makes his wife, nor as she deserves
to be loved; and even if you refuse me I shall
not marry her. It would be a great sin to take her
when my whole soul was longing for another.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Grant, are you crazy? Don’t you know you must
marry Thea? Have you forgotten the Hepburn line?”
Doris said, lifting her head from his shoulder and turning
towards him a face which, although bathed in tears,
was radiant with the light of a great joy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Had Grant been in the habit of swearing, he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>probably have consigned the Hepburn line to perdition.
As it was, he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Confound the Hepburn line! Enough have been
made miserable on account of it, and I don’t propose to
be added to the number, nor do I believe much in it,
either. Aleck does not believe in it at all, and we are
going to look up the law without Aunt Kizzy’s knowledge.
She is so cursed proud and reticent, too, or she
would have found out for herself before this time
whether we are likely to be beggared or not. And
even if the lease holds good, don’t you suppose that a
great strapping fellow like me can take care of himself
and four women?”</p>

<p class='c012'>As he had never yet done anything but spend money,
it seemed doubtful to Doris whether he could do anything
or not. But she did not care. The fact that he
loved her, that he held her in his arms and was covering
her face with kisses, was enough for the present,
and for a few moments Aunt Kizzy’s wrath and the
Hepburn line were forgotten, while she abandoned
herself to her great happiness. Then she remembered,
and, releasing herself from Grant, stood up before him
and told him that it could not be.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am not ashamed to confess that I love you,” she
said, “and the knowing that you love me will always
make me happier. But you are bound to Thea, and I
will never separate you from her or bring ruin upon
your family. I will go away, as I said, and never come
again until you and Thea are married.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was backing from the summer-house as she
talked, and so absorbed were she and Grant both that
neither saw nor heard anything until, having reached
the door, Doris backed into Thea’s arms.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>“Hello!” was her characteristic exclamation, as she
looked curiously at Doris and then at Grant, who,
greatly confused, had risen to his feet, “And so I
have caught you,” she continued, “and I suppose you
think I am angry; but I am not. I am glad, as it
makes easier what I am going to tell you. Sit down,
Grant, and hear me,” she continued authoritatively, as
she saw him moving towards the doorway, opposite to
where she stood, still holding Doris tightly. “Sit
down, and let’s have it out, like sensible people who
have been mistaken and discovered their mistake in
time. I know you love Doris, and I know she loves
you, and she just suits you, for she is beautiful and
sweet and fresh, while I am neither; I am homely,
and fast, and slangy, and sometimes loud and forward.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Thea, Thea, you are not all this,” Doris cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Thea went on: “Yes, I am; Aleck says so, and
he knows, and that is why I like him so much. He tells
me my faults straight out, which Grant never did. He
simply endured me because he felt that he must, until he
saw you, and then it was not in the nature of things
that I could keep him any longer. I have seen it, and
so has Aleck; and this morning, under the great elm
in the far part of the grounds, we came to an understanding,
and I told the great, awkward, ugly Aleck
that I loved him better than I ever loved Grant; and I
do,—I do!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was half crying, and breathing hard, and with
each breath was severing some link which had bound
her to Grant, who for once felt as awkward as Aleck
himself, and stood abashed before the young girl who
was so boldly declaring her preference for another.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>What could he say? he asked himself. He surely could
not remonstrate with her, or protest against what would
make him so happy, and so he kept silent, while brushing
the tears from her eyes, she continued, “I don’t know
when it began, or how, only it did begin, and now I
don’t care how ugly he is, nor how big his feet and
hands are. He is just as good as he can be, and I am going
to marry him. There!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She stopped, quite out of breath, and looked at Doris,
whose face was very white, and whose voice trembled
as she said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Thea, have you forgotten the <em>lease</em>?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The lease!” Thea repeated, bitterly. “I hate the
very name. It has worked so much mischief, and all for
nothing, Aleck says, and he knows, and don’t believe it
would stand a moment, and if it does we have arranged
for it, and should the Morton estate ever come to me
through Aunt Kizzy’s foolish insistence, I shall deed it
straight back to her, or to you and Grant, which will be
better. It is time old Amos Hepburn was euchred, and
I am glad to do it. Such trouble as he has brought to
your grandfather, your father, and to me, thrusting me
upon one who did not care a dime for me!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thea, Thea, you are mistaken. I did care for you
until I saw Doris, and I care for you yet,” Grant said,
and Thea replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“In a way, yes. But you were driven to it by Aunt
Kizzy, and so was I. Why, I do not remember a time
when I did not think I was to marry you, and once I
liked the idea, too, and threw myself at your head, and
appropriated you in a way which makes me ashamed
when I remember it. Aleck has told me, and he knows,
and will keep me straight, while you would have let me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>run wild, and from a bold, pert, slangy girl I should have
degenerated into a coarse, second-class woman, with
only money and the Morton name to keep me up. You
and Doris exactly suit each other, and your lives will
glide along without a ripple, while Aleck’s and mine
will be stormy at times, for he has a will and I have a
temper, but the making up will be grand, and that I
should never have known with you. I am going to tell
Aunt Kizzy now, and have it over. So, Grant, let’s say
good-bye to all there has been between us, and if you
want to kiss me once in memory of the past you can do
so. Doris will not mind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was something very pathetic in Thea’s manner
as she lifted her face for the kiss which was to part her
and Grant forever, and for an instant her arms clung
tightly around his neck as if the olden love were dying
hard in spite of what she had said of Aleck; then without
a word she went swiftly up the walk, leaving Grant
and Doris alone.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.—<span class='sc'>Doris’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>THE MISSING LINK.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>How can I write when my heart is so full that it
seems as if it would burst with its load of surprise and
happiness? Grant and I are engaged, and so are Thea
and Aleck, and of the two I believe Thea is happier
than I, who am still so stunned that I can scarcely realize
what a few hours have brought to me,—Grant, and—and—a
fortune! And this is how it happened.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Grant was saying things to me which I thought he
ought not to say, when Thea came suddenly upon  us
and told us she loved Aleck better than she did Grant,
whom she transferred to me in a rather bewildering
fashion, while I accepted him on condition that Aunt
Kizzy gave her consent. She did not appear at dinner
that night, and the next morning she was suffering from
a severe headache and kept her room, but sent word
that she would see Thea and Grant after breakfast.
This left me to Aleck, who came early and asked me to
go with him to the summer-house, where we could “talk
over the row,” as he expressed it. Love had certainly
wrought a great change in him, softening and refining
his rugged features until he seemed almost handsome
as he talked to me of Thea, whom he had fancied from
the time he first saw her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is full of faults, I know,” he said, “but I believe I
love her the better for them, as they will add variety to
our lives. She and Grant would have stagnated, as he
did not care enough for her to oppose her in any way.
Theirs would have been a marriage of convenience;
ours will be one of love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And then he drifted off to the Morton lease and Hepburn
line and family tree.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have never seen it, I believe,” he said, taking
from his pocket a sheet of foolscap and spreading it out
upon his lap. He had offered to show it to me before,
but I had declined examining it. Now, however, I affected
to be interested, and glanced indifferently at the
sheet, with its queer looking diagrams and rows of
names, which he called branches of the Hepburn tree.
“I have not made it out quite ship-shape, like one I saw
in London lately,” he said, taking out his pencil and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>pointing to the name which headed the list, “but I
think you will understand it. You have no idea what
a fascination there has been to me in hunting up my
ancestors and wondering what manner of people they
were. First, here is Amos Hepburn, the old curmudgeon
who leased that property to your grandfather ninety
years ago. He married Dorothea Foster, and had three
daughters, Octavia, Agrippina, and Poppæa.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Octavia, Agrippina, and Poppæa,” I exclaimed.
“What could have induced him to give these names to
his daughters?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Classical taste, I suppose,” Aleck said. “No doubt
the old gentleman was fond of Roman history, and the
names took his fancy. If he had had a son he would
probably have called him Nero. Poppæa, the youngest,
is my maternal ancestress. I inherit my beauty
from her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here he laughed heartily, and then went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Agrippina, the second daughter, was Thea’s great-grandmother,
and called no doubt after the good Agrippina,
and not the bad one, who had that ducking in the
sea at the hands of her precious son. As to the eldest
daughter, she ought to have felt honored to be named
for the poor little abused Empress Octavia; and then it
is a pretty name.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, indeed,” I said, “and it is <em>my</em> middle name,
which my grandmother and my great-grandmother bore
before me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s odd,” he rejoined, looking curiously at me.
“Yes, very odd. Suppose we go over Thea’s branch
of the tree first, as that is the oldest line to which a
direct heir can be found, and consequently gives her the
Morton estate. First, Agrippina Hepburn married John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Austin, and had one child, Charlotte Poppæa, who
married Tom Haynes, and bore him one daughter,
Sophia, and two sons, James and John. This John, by
the way, I have heard, was the young man whom Miss
Keziah wished your Aunt Beriah to marry, and failing
in that she wished your father to marry Sophia. But
neither plan worked, for both died, and James married
Victoria Snead, of Louisville, and had one daughter,
Dorothea Victoria, otherwise Thea, my promised wife,
and the great-great-grandaughter of old Amos Hepburn.
As I, although several years older than Thea, am in the
third and youngest branch of the tree, I have no claim
on the Morton estate; neither would Thea have, if I
could find the missing link in the first and oldest branch,
that of Octavia, who was married in Port Rush, Ireland,
to Mr. McMahon, and had twins, Augustus Octavius,
and Octavia Augusta. You see she, too, was classically
inclined, like her father. Well, Augustus Octavius
died, and Octavia Augusta married Henry Gale, a hatter,
in Leamington, England, and emigrated to America
in 18—, and settled in New York, where all trace of her
is lost. Nor can I by any possible means find anything
about her, except that Henry Gale died, but whether he
left children I do not know. Presumably he did, and
their descendants would be the real heirs to the Morton
property, if that clause holds good. Do you see the
point? or, as Thea would say, do you tumble?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He repeated his question in a louder tone, as I did
not answer him, but sat staring at the unfinished branch
of the Hepburn tree. I did tumble nearly off the seat,
and only kept myself from doing so entirely by clutching
Aleck’s arm and holding it so tightly that he winced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>a little as he moved away from me, and said: “What’s
the matter? Has something stung you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” I replied, with a gasp, and a feeling that I was
choking, or fainting, or both.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had followed him closely through Agrippina’s line,
and had felt a little bored when he began on Octavia’s,
but only for an instant, and then I was all attention, and
felt my blood prickling in my veins and saw rings of fire
dancing before my eyes, as I glanced at the names, as
familiar to me as old friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aleck,” I whispered, for I could not speak aloud,
“these are all my ancestors, I am sure, for do you think
it possible for two Octavias and two McMahons to have
been married in Port Rush and had twins whom they
called Octavia Augusta and Augustus Octavius, and for
Augustus to die and Octavia to marry a Mr. Gale, a hatter,
in Leamington, and emigrate to New York?”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Aleck’s turn now to stare and turn pale, as he
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I mean,” I said, “that my great-grandmother’s
name was Octavia, but I never heard that it was also
Hepburn, or if I did I have forgotten it. I know,
though, that she married a McMahon and lived at Port
Rush. I know, too, that Mrs. McMahon had twins,
whose names were Augustus Octavius and Octavia
Augusta. Augustus died, but Octavia, who was my
grandmother, first married a Mr. Gale, a hatter, in
Leamington, and then came to New York, where he
died. She then went to Boston, married Charles Wilson,
and moved to New Haven, where my mother,
Dorothea Augusta, was born, and where she married
my father. I have a record of it in an old English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>book, which, after my grandmother’s death, was sent to
my mother with some other things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eureka! I have found the missing link, <em>and you are
it</em>! Hurrah!” Aleck exclaimed, springing to his feet
and catching me up as if I had been a feather’s weight.
“I was never more surprised in my life, or glad either.
To think here is the link right in Miss Kizzy’s hands!
Wouldn’t she have torn her hair if Grant had married
Thea? By Jove, it would have been a joke, and a sort
of retributive justice, too. I must tell her myself. But
first let’s be perfectly sure. You spoke of a record.
Do you happen to have it with you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, in my trunk,” I said, and, excusing myself for
a few moments, I flew to the house, and soon returned
with what had originally been a blank-book and which
my grandmother had used for many purposes, such as
recording family expenses, names of people who had
boarded with her, and when they came, what they paid
her, and when they left; dates, too, of various events in
her life, together with receipts for cooking; and pinned
to the last page was an old yellow sheet of foolscap,
with the name of a Leamington bookseller just discernible
upon it. On this sheet were records in two or three
different handwritings. The first was the birth in
Leamington of Augustus Octavius and Octavia Augusta,
children of Patrick and Octavia McMahon, who
were married in Port Rush, April 10th, 18—. Then followed
the death of Augustus and the marriage of Octavia
to William Gale, of Leamington. Then, in my
grandmother’s handwriting, the death of Mr. Gale in
New York, followed by a masculine hand, presumably
that of my grandfather, Charles Wilson, who married
Mrs. Octavia Gale in Boston, and to whom my mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Dorothea Augusta, was born in New Haven. I remember
perfectly well seeing my mother record the date of
her marriage with my father and of my birth on the
sheet of foolscap after it came to her with the other
papers from my grandmother, but when or why it was
pinned into the blank-book I could not tell. I only
knew it was there, and that I had kept the book, which
I now handed to Aleck, whose face wore a puzzled look
as, opening it at random, he began to read a receipt for
ginger snaps.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What the dickens has this to do with Cæsar Augustus
and Augustus Cæsar?” he asked, while I showed
him the sheet of paper, which he read very attentively
twice, and compared with his family tree. “You <em>are</em>
the Link, and no mistake!” he said. “Everything fits
to a T, as far as my tree goes. Of course it will have to
be proven, but that is easily done by beginning at this
end and working back to where the branch failed to
connect. And now I am going to tell Miss Morton and
Grant. Will you come with me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” I replied, feeling that I had not strength to
walk to the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was so confused and stunned and weak that I could
only sit still and think of nothing until Grant’s arms
were around me and he was covering my face with
kisses and calling me his darling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aleck has told us the strangest story,” he said, “and
I am so glad for you, and glad that I asked you to be
my wife before I heard it, as you know it is yourself I
want, and not what you may or may not bring me.
Aunt Kizzy is in an awful collapse,—fainted dead away
when she heard it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Grant, how could you leave her and come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>me?” I asked, reproachfully, and he replied, “Because
I could do no good. There were Aunts Dizzy and Brier,
and Thea, and Aleck, and Vine, all throwing water and
camphor and vinegar in her face, until she looked like
a drowned rat. So I came out and left them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I must go to her,” I said, and with Grant’s arm
around me I went slowly to the house and into the
room where Aunt Kizzy lay among her pillows, with an
expression on her face such as I had never seen before.
It was not anger, but rather one of intense relief, as
if the tension of years had given way and left every
nerve quivering from the long strain, but painless and
restful. Thea was fanning her; Aunt Brier was bathing
her forehead with cologne; Aunt Dizzy was arranging
her false piece, which was somewhat awry; while
Aleck was still energetically explaining his family tree
and comparing it with the paper I had given him. At
sight of me Aunt Kizzy’s eyes grew blacker than their
wont, while something like a smile flitted across her
face as she said, “This is a strange story I have heard,
and it will of course have to be proved.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A task I take upon myself,” Aleck interrupted, and
she went on to catechise me rather sharply with regard
to my ancestors.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is strange that your father did not find it out, if
he saw this paper.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He did not see it, for it was not sent to us until after
his death,” I said, while Aunt Dizzy rejoined, “And if
he had it would have conveyed no meaning to him, as I
do not suppose he ever troubled himself to trace the
Hepburn line to its beginning or knew that Mrs.
McMahon was a Hepburn. I have no idea what my
great-grandmother’s name was before she was married.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>For me, I need no confirmation whatever, but accept
Doris as I have always accepted her, a dear little girl
whose coming to us has brought a blessing with it, and
although I am very fond of Thea, and should have
loved her as Grant’s wife, I am still very glad it is to
be Doris.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was standing by me now, with her hand on my
shoulder, while Aunt Brier and Thea both came to my
side, the latter throwing her arms around my neck and
saying, “And I am glad it is Doris, and that the Hepburn
line is torn into shreds. I believe I hate that old
Amos, who, by the way, is as much your ancestor as
mine, for we are cousins, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She kissed me lovingly, and, putting my hand in
Aunt Kizzy’s, said to her, “Aren’t you glad it is
Doris?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then Aunt Kizzy did a most extraordinary thing for
her. She drew me close to her and cried like a child.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” she said, “I am glad it is Doris, and sorry
that I have been so hard with everybody, first with
Beriah, and then with Gerold, whom I loved as if he
had been my own son, and who it seems married into
the Hepburn line and I did not know it. And I have
loved you, too, Doris, more than you guess, notwithstanding
I have seemed so cross and cold and crabbed.
I have been a monomaniac on the subject of the Hepburn
lease. Can you forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I could easily answer that question, for with her first
kind word all the ill feeling I had ever cherished against
her was swept away, and, putting my face to hers, I
kissed her more than once, in token of peace between us.</p>

<p class='c012'>That afternoon Aleck started North with his family
tree and my family record, and, beginning at the date
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>of my mother’s marriage, worked backward until the
branch which had been broken with the Gales in New
York was united with the Wilsons of New Haven,
“making a beautiful whole,” as he wrote in a letter to
Thea, who was to me like a dear sister, and who, with
her perfect tact, treated Grant as if they had never
been more to each other than friends. Those were very
happy days which followed, and now, instead of being
the least, I think I am the most considered of all in the
household, and in her grave way Aunt Kizzy pets me
more than any one else, except, of course, Grant, whose
love grows stronger every day, until I sometimes
tremble with fear lest my happiness may not last. We
are to be married at Christmas time, and are going
abroad, and whether I shall ever write again in this
journal I cannot tell. Years hence I may perhaps look
at it and think how foolish I was ever to have kept it at
all. There is Grant calling me to try a new wheel he
has bought for me, and I must go. I can ride a wheel
now, or do anything I like, and Aunt Kizzy does not
object. But I don’t think I care to do many things, and,
except to please Grant, I do not care much for a wheel,
being still, as Thea says, something of a <em>softie</em>.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII.—<span class='sc'>Aunt Desire’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>THE THREE BRIDES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I am too old now to commence a diary; but the
house is so lonely with only Keziah and myself in it
that I must do something, and so I will record briefly
the events of the last few weeks, or rather months,
since the astounding disclosure that Doris and not Thea
was the direct heir in the Hepburn line. Nothing ever
broke Keziah up like that, transforming her whole
nature and making her quite like other people and so
fond of Doris that she could scarcely bear to have her
out of sight a moment, and when Grant and Doris were
married and gone she cried like a baby, although some
of her tears, let us hope, were for Beriah, who will not
come back to live with us again, while Doris will.</p>

<p class='c012'>And right here let me speak of Beriah’s little
romance, which has ended so happily. Years ago she
loved Tom Atkins, but Kizzy separated them, in the
hope that Brier would marry John Haynes, of the
Hepburn line, as possibly she might have done, for she
was mortally afraid of Kizzy. But John had the good
taste to die, and Brier remained in single blessedness
until she was past forty, when Tom, who she supposed
was dead, turned up unexpectedly in Cairo. Grant, who
was there at the time, made his acquaintance and
brought a message from him to Brier, who, after receiving
it, never seemed herself, but sat for hours with her
hands folded and a look on her face as if listening or
waiting for some one, who came at last.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>It was in November, and the maple-leaves were drifting
down in great piles of scarlet in the park, and in
the woods there was the sound of dropping nuts, and on
the hills a smoky light, telling of “the melancholy days,
the saddest of the year.” But with us there was anything
but sadness, for two brides-elect were in the
house, Doris and Thea, who were to be married at
Christmas, and whose trousseaus were making in Frankfort
and Versailles. Thea had expressed a wish to be
married at Morton Park on the same day with Doris,
and, as her guardian did not object, she was staying
with us altogether, while Aleck came every day. So
we had a good deal of love-making, and the doors which
used to be shut promptly at half-past nine were left
open for the young people, who, in different parts of
the grounds, or piazza, told over and over again the old
story which, no matter how many times it is told, is
ever new to her who hears and him who tells it.</p>

<p class='c012'>One morning when Aleck came as usual, he said to
Grant, “By the way, do you remember that chap, half
Arab and half American, whom we met in Cairo? Atkins
was the name. Well, he arrived at the hotel last
night, with that wild-eyed little girl and two Arabian
servants, one for him, one for the child. He used to
know some of your people, and is coming this morning
to call, with his little girl, who is not bad-looking in her
English dress.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We had just come from breakfast, and were sitting
on the piazza, Grant with Doris, and Brier with that
preoccupied look on her face which it had worn so long.
But her expression changed suddenly as Aleck talked,
and it seemed to me I could see the years roll off from
her, leaving her young again; and she was certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>very pretty when two hours later, in her gray serge
gown with its trimmings of navy blue, and her brown
hair, just tinged with white, waving softly around her
forehead, she went down to meet Tom Atkins, from
whom she parted more than twenty years ago. We had
him to lunch and we had him to dinner, and we had
him finally almost as much as we did Aleck, and I could
scarcely walk in any direction that I did not see a pair
of lovers, half hidden by shrub or tree.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Pears like dey’s a love-makin’ from mornin’ till
night, an’ de ole ones is wuss dan de young,” I heard
Adam say to Vine, and I fully concurred with him, for,
as if he would make up for lost time, Tom could not go
near Brier without taking her hand or putting his arm
around her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just what he said to her of the past I know not,
except that he told her of dreary wanderings in foreign
lands, of utter indifference as to whether he lived or
died, until in Athens he met a pretty Greek, whom,
under a sudden impulse, he made his wife, and who
died when their little Zaidee was born, twelve years
ago. After that he spent most of his time in Egypt,
where he has a palatial home near Alexandria, with at
least a dozen servants. Last winter he chanced to
meet Grant at Shepheard’s Hotel in Cairo, and, learning
from him that Beriah was still unmarried, he decided
to come home, and, if he found her as unchanged in
her feelings as he was, he would ask her a second time
to be his wife. So he came, and the vows of old were
renewed, and little Zaidee stayed with us altogether, so
as to get acquainted with her new mamma that was to
be. She is a shy, timid child, who has been thrown
mostly with Arabs and Egyptians, but she is very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>affectionate, and her love for Beriah was touching in its
intensity.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Thea heard of the engagement she begged for
a triple wedding, and carried her point, as she usually
does. “A blow-out, too,” she said she wanted, as she
should never marry but once, and a <em>blow-out</em> we had,
with four hundred invitations, and people from Cincinnati,
Lexington, Louisville, Frankfort, and Versailles.
There were lanterns on all the trees in the park, and
fireworks on the lawn, and two bands in different parts
of the grounds, and the place looked the next morning
as if a cyclone or the battle of Gettysburg had swept
over it. The brides were lovely, although Doris, of
course, bore off the palm for beauty, but Thea was exceedingly
pretty, while Beriah reminded me of a Madonna,
she looked so sweet and saintly, as she stood by
Tom, who, the moment the ceremony was over, just
took her in his arms and hugged her before us all.
Zaidee was her bridesmaid, while Kizzy was Doris’s
and I was Thea’s, and in my cream-colored silk looked,
they said, nearly as young as the girls.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next morning the newly married people left <i><span lang="fr">en
route</span></i> for Europe, and the last we heard from them they
were at Brindisi, waiting for the Hydaspes, which was
to take them to Alexandria. Doris will come back to
live with us again in the autumn, but Brier never, and
when I think of that, and remember all she was to me,
and her patience and gentleness and unselfishness,
there is a bitter pain in my heart, and my tears fall so
fast that I have blurred this sheet so that no one but
myself can read it. I am glad she has Tom at last, although
her going from us makes me so lonely and sad
and brings back the dreary past and all I lost when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Henry died. But some time, and that not very far in
the future, I shall meet my love, dead now so many
years that, counting by them I am old, but, reckoned
by my feelings, I am still young as he was when he
died, and as he will be when he welcomes me inside the
gate of the celestial city, and says to me in the voice I
remember so well, “I am waiting for you, darling, and
now come rest awhile before I show you some of the
glories of the heavenly world, and the people who are
here, Douglas, and Maria, and Gerold, and all the rest
who loved you on earth, and who love you still with a
more perfect love, because born of the Master whose
name is love eternal.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.—<span class='sc'>Doris’s Story.</span><br> <span class='large'>TWO YEARS LATER.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It is just two years since that triple wedding, when
six people were made as happy as it is possible to be in
this world, Aunt Brier and Mr. Atkins, Aleck and Thea,
and Grant and myself, on whom no shadow has fallen
since I became Grant’s wife and basked in the fullness
of his love, which grows stronger and more tender as
the days go on. He is now studying hard in a law office
in town, determined to fit himself for something useful,
and if possible atone for the selfish, useless life he led
before we were married. We spent a year abroad,
going everywhere with Aleck and Thea, and staying a
few weeks in Mr. Atkins’s elegant villa near Alexandria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>where everything is done in the most luxurious and Oriental
manner, and Aunt Brier was a very queen among
her subjects. When the year of travel was ended we
came back to Morton Park, where a royal welcome
awaited us, and where Aunt Kizzy took me in her arms
and cried over me a little and then led me to my room,
or rather rooms, one of which was the Glory Hole,
which had been fitted up as a boudoir, or dressing-room,
while the large, airy chamber adjacent, where Thea
used to sleep, had also been thoroughly repaired and
refurnished, and was given to us in place of Grant’s old
room.</p>

<p class='c012'>And here this Christmas morning I am finishing my
journal, in which I have recorded so much of my life,—more,
in fact, than I care to read. I wish I had left out
a good deal about Aunt Kizzy. She is greatly changed
from the grim woman who held me at arm’s length
when I first came from school, and of whom I stood in
fear. We have talked that all over, and made it up, and
every day she gives me some new proof of her affection.
But the greatest transformation in her came some weeks
ago, with the advent of a little boy, who is sleeping in
his crib, with a yellow-turbaned negress keeping watch
over him. Aunt Kizzy calls herself his grandmother, and
tends him more, if possible, than the nurse. Grant laments
that it is not a girl, so as to bear some one or two
of the queer names of its ancestors. But I am glad it is
a boy, and next Sunday it will be christened Gerold
Douglas, for my father and grandfather, and Aleck and
Thea will stand for it. They have bought a beautiful
place a little out of town and have settled down into a
regular Darby and Joan, wholly satisfied with each
Other and lacking nothing to make them perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>happy. Aunt Brier and Mr. Atkins are also here, staying
in the house until spring, when they will build on a
part of the Morton estate which Mr. Atkins has bought
of Grant. Oriental life did not suit Aunt Brier, and, as
her slightest wish is sacred to her husband, he has
brought her to her old home, where, when Aleck and
Thea are with us, we make a very merry party, talking
of all we have seen in Europe, and sometimes of the
Hepburn line, which Aleck says I straightened,—always
insisting, however, that it did not need straightening,
and that the obnoxious clause in the lease would never
have stood the test of the law. Whether it would or not,
I do not know, as we have never inquired.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MILDRED’S AMBITION.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>MILDRED.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The time was a hot morning in July, the place one of
those little mountain towns between Albany and Pittsfield,
and the scene opens in a farm house kitchen,
where Mildred Leach was seated upon the doorstep
shelling peas, with her feet braced against the doorjamb
to keep her baby brother, who was creeping on the
floor, from tumbling out, and her little sister Bessie,
who was standing outside, from coming in. On the bed
in a room off the kitchen Mildred’s mother was lying
with a headache, and both the kitchen and the bedroom
smelled of camphor and vinegar, and the vegetables
which were cooking on the stove and filling the house
with the odor which made the girl faint and sick, as she
leaned against the door-post and longed, as she always was
longing, for some change in her monotonous life. Of
the world outside the mountain town where she was
born she knew very little, and that little she had learned
from Hugh McGregor, the village doctor’s son, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>had been away to school, and seen the President and
New York and a Cunarder as it came sailing up the harbor.
On his return home Hugh had narrated his
adventures to Mildred, who listened with kindling eyes
and flushed cheeks, exclaiming, when he finished,
“Oh! if I could see all that; and I will some day. I
shall not stay forever in old Rocky Point. I hate it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred was only thirteen, and not pretty, as girls
usually are at that age. She was thin and sallow, and
her great brown eyes were too large for her face, and
her thick curly hair too heavy for her head. A mop her
brother Tom called it, when trying to tease her; and
Mildred hated her hair and hated herself whenever she
looked in the ten by twelve glass in her room, and
never dreamed of the wonderful beauty which later on
she would develop, when her face and form were
rounded out, her sallow complexion cleared, and her
hair subdued and softened into a mass of waves and
curls. Her father, John Leach, was a poor farmer, who,
although he owned the house in which he lived, together
with a few acres of stony land around it, was in
one sense a tenant of Mr. Giles Thornton, the proprietor
of Thornton Park, for he rented land enough of
him to eke out his slender income. To Mildred, Thornton
Park was a Paradise, and nothing she had ever read
or heard of equaled it in her estimation, and many a
night when she should have been asleep she stood at
her window, looking off in the distance at the turrets
and towers of the beautiful place which elicited admiration
from people much older than herself. To live
there would be perfect bliss, she thought, even though
she were as great an invalid as its mistress, and as sickly
and helpless as little Alice, the only daughter of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>house. Against her own humble surroundings Mildred
was in hot rebellion, and was always planning for improvement
and change, not only for herself, but for her
family, whom she loved devotedly, and to whom she
was giving all the strength of her young life. Mrs.
Leach was a martyr to headaches, which frequently
kept her in bed for days, during which time the care
and the work fell upon Mildred, whose shoulders were
too slender for the burden they bore.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it will be different some time,” she was thinking
on that hot July morning when she sat shelling
peas, sometimes kissing Charlie, whose fat hands were
either making havoc with the pods or pulling her hair,
and sometimes scolding Bessie for chewing her bonnet
strings and soiling her clean apron.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must look nice when Mrs. Thornton goes by,”
she said, for Mrs. Thornton was expected from New
York that day, and Mildred was watching for the return
of the carriage, which half an hour before had passed
on its way to the station.</p>

<p class='c012'>And very soon it came in sight,—a handsome
barouche, drawn by two shining black horses, with a
long-coated driver on the box, and Mr. and Mrs. Thornton
and the two children inside,—Gerard, a dark, handsome
boy of eleven, and Alice, a sickly little girl, with
some spinal trouble which kept her from walking or
playing as other children did. Leaning back upon
cushions was Mrs. Thornton,—her face very pale, and
her eyes closed, while opposite her, with his gold-headed
cane in his hand, was Mr. Thornton,—a tall, handsome
man who carried himself as grandly as if the blood of a
hundred kings was flowing in his veins. He did not see
the children on the doorsteps, until Gerard, in response
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>to a nod from Mildred, lifted his cap, while Alice leaned
eagerly forward and said, “Look, mamma, there’s Milly
and Bessie and the baby. Hello, Milly. I’ve comed
back;” then he said quickly, “Allie, be quiet; and you
Gerard, why do you lift your cap to such people? It’s
not necessary;” and in these few words was embodied
the character of the man.</p>

<p class='c012'>Courteous to his equals, but proud and haughty to
his inferiors, with an implicit belief in the Thorntons
and no belief at all in such people as the Leaches, or indeed
in many of the citizens of Rocky Point, where he
owned, or held mortgages on, half the smaller premises.
The world was made for him, and he was Giles Thornton,
of English extraction on his father’s side and
Southern blood on his mother’s, and in his pride and
pomposity he went on past the old red farm house,
while Mildred sat for a moment looking after the carriage
and envying its occupants.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, if I were rich, like Mrs. Thornton, and could
wear silks and jewels; and I will, some day,” she said,
with a far-off look in her eyes, as if she were seeing the
future and what it held for her. “Yes, I will be rich,
no matter what it costs,” she continued, “and people
shall envy me, and I’ll make father and mother so
happy? and you, Charlie”——</p>

<p class='c012'>Here she stopped, and parting the curls from her
baby brother’s brow, looked earnestly into his blue eyes;
then went on, “you shall have a golden crown, and you,
Bessie darling, shall have,—shall have,—Gerard Thornton
himself, if you want him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I lame Alice?” asked a cheery voice, as there
bounded into the kitchen a ten year old lad, who, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>his naked feet, sunny face and torn straw hat, might
have stood for Whittier’s barefoot boy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Tom,” Mildred cried, “I’m glad you’ve come.
Won’t you pick up the pods while I get the peas into
the pot? It’s almost noon, and I’ve got the table to
set.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Before Tom could reply, another voice called out,
“You have given Gerard to Bessie and Alice to Tom;
now what am I to have, Miss Prophetess?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The speaker was a fair-haired youth of seventeen,
with a slight Scotch accent and a frank, open, genial
face, such as strangers always trust. He had stopped a
moment at the corner of the house to pick a rose for
Mildred, and hearing her prophecies, sauntered leisurely
to the doorstep, where he sat down, and fanning himself
with his big hat, asked what she had for him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing, Hugh McGregor,” Mildred replied, with a
little flush on her cheek. “Nothing but that;” and she
tossed him a pea-pod she had picked from the floor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks,” Hugh said, catching the pod in his hand.
“There are two peas in it yet, a big and a little one. I
am the big, you are the little, and I’m going to keep
them and see which hardens first, you or I.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a fool you are,” Mildred said, with increased
color on her cheek, while Hugh pocketed the pod and
went on: “A crown for Charlie, Gerard for Bessie,
Allie for Tom, a pea-pod for me, and what for you, my
darling?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am not your darling,” Mildred answered quickly;
“and I’m going to be,—mistress of Thornton Park,”
she added, after a little hesitancy, while Hugh rejoined:
“As you have given Gerard to Bessie, I don’t see how
you’ll bring it about, unless Mrs. Thornton dies, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>thing not unlikely, and you marry that big-feeling man,
whom you say you hate because he turned you from his
premises. Have you forgotten that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred had not forgotten it, and her face was scarlet
as she recalled the time the past summer when,
wishing to buy a dress for Charlie, then six months old,
she had gone into one of Mr. Thornton’s pastures after
huckleberries, which grew there so abundantly, and
which found a ready market at the groceries in town.
In Rocky Point, berries were considered public property,
and she had no thought that she was trespassing
until a voice close to her said, “What are you doing
here? Begone, before I have you arrested.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In great alarm Mildred had seized her ten quart pail,
which was nearly full, and hurried away, never venturing
again upon the forbidden ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I remember it,” she said, “but that wouldn’t
keep me from being mistress of the Park, if I had a
chance and he wasn’t there. Wouldn’t I make a good
one?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ye-es,” Hugh answered slowly, as he looked her
over from her head to her feet. “But you’ll have to
grow taller and fill out some, and do something with
that snarly pate of yours, which looks this morning like
an oven broom,” and with this thrust at her bushy hair
Hugh disappeared from the door just in time to escape
the dipper of water which went splashing after him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oven broom, indeed!” Mildred said indignantly,
with a pull at the broom; “I wonder if I am to blame
for my hair. I hate it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was Mildred’s favorite expression, and there
were but few things to which she had not applied it.
But most of all she hated her humble home and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>boiled dinner she put upon the table just as the clock
struck twelve, wondering as she did so if they knew
what such a dish was at Thornton Park, and what they
were having there that day.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>AT THORNTON PARK.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the barouche had stopped under the
grand archway at the side entrance of the Park house,
where a host of servants was in waiting; the butler,
the housekeeper, the cook, the laundress, the maids, the
gardener and groom and several more, for, aping his
English ancestry and the custom of his mother’s Southern
home before the war, Mr. Thornton kept about him
a retinue of servants with whom he was very popular.
He paid them well and fed them well, and while requiring
from them the utmost deference, was kind in
every way, and they came crowding around him with
words of welcome and offers of assistance. Mrs. Thornton
went at once to her room, while Alice was taken
possession of by her nurse, who had come from the city
the night before, and who soon had her charge in a
little willow carriage, drawing her around the grounds.
Gerard, who was a quiet, studious boy, went to the
library, while Mr. Thornton, after seeing that his wife
was comfortable, joined his little daughter, whose love
for her country home he knew, and to whom he said,
“I suppose you are quite happy now?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>“Yes, papa,” she replied, “only I want somebody to
play with me. Ann is too big. I want Milly Leach.
She was so nice to me last summer. Can’t I have her,
papa?”</p>

<p class='c012'>For Alice to want a thing was for her to have it, if
possession were possible, and her father answered her:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, daughter, you shall have her,” without knowing
at all who Milly Leach was. But Alice explained that
she was the girl who lived in the little red house where
Ann had often taken her the summer before to play
with Tom and Bessie. And so it came about that Ann
was sent that afternoon to the farm house with a request
from Mr. Thornton that Mildred should come for the
summer and amuse his daughter. Three dollars a week
was the remuneration offered, for he always held out a
golden bait when the fish was doubtful, as he
thought it might be in this case. Mrs. Leach was
better, and sitting up while Mildred combed and brushed
the hair much like her own, except that it was softer
and smoother, because it had more care and there was
less of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, mother,” she cried, when Ann made her
errand known, “can’t I go? Three dollars a week!
Only think, what a lot; and I’ll give it all to you, and
you can get that pretty French calico at Mr. Overton’s
store. May I go?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who will do the work when I’m sick?” Mrs. Leach
asked, herself a good deal moved by the three dollars a
week, which seemed a fortune to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I guess they’ll let me come home when you have
a headache,” Milly pleaded, and on this condition it
was finally arranged that she should go to the Park for
a time at least, and two days after we saw her shelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>peas and longing for a change, the change came and
she started out on her career in her best gingham dress
and white apron, with her small satchel of clothes in her
hand and a great lump in her throat as she kissed her
mother and Bessie and Charlie, and would have kissed
Tom if he had not disappeared with a don’t-care air
and a watery look in his eyes, which he wiped with his
checked shirt sleeve, and then, boy-like, threw a green
apple after his sister, hiding behind the tree when she
looked around to see whence it came.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a lovely morning, and Thornton Park lay fair
and beautiful in the distance as she walked rapidly on
until a familiar whistle stopped her and she saw Hugh
hurrying across the fields and waving his hat to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello!” he said, as he came to her side, “I nearly
broke my neck to catch you. And so you are
going to be a hired girl. Let me carry that satchel,”
and he took it from her while she answered hotly, “I
ain’t a hired girl. I’m Allie’s little friend; that’s what
she said when she came with Ann last night and we
made the bargain, and I’m to have three dollars a
week.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Three dollars a week! That is big,” Hugh said,
staggered a little at the price. “But, I say, don’t go so
fast. Let’s sit down awhile and talk;” and seating himself
upon a log, with Mildred beside him and the
satchel at his feet, he went on: “Milly, I don’t want
you to go to Thornton Park. Won’t you give it up?
Seems as if I was losing you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You never had me to lose,” was the girl’s reply, and
Hugh continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s so; but I mean that I like you better than any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>girl I ever knew; like you just as I should my sister if
I had one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here Milly elevated her eyebrows a little, while
Hugh went on: “And I don’t want you to go to that
fine place and learn to despise us all, and the old home
by the brook.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall never do that, for I love father and mother
and Tom and Bessie and Charlie better than I do myself.
I’d die for them, but I do hate the old house
and the poverty and work, and I mean to be a grand
lady and rich, and then I’ll help them all, and you, too,
if you’ll let me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t need your help, and I don’t want to see you
a grand lady, and I don’t want you to be snubbed by
that proud Thornton,” Hugh replied, and Milly
answered quickly, with short, emphatic nods of her
head:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I sha’n’t be snubbed by him, for if he sasses me I
shall sass him. I’ve made up my mind to that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And when you do may I be there to hear; but you
are a brick, any way,” was Hugh’s laughing rejoinder,
and as Milly had risen to her feet, he, too, arose, and
taking up the satchel walked with her to the Park gate,
where he said good-bye, but called to her after a minute,
“I say, Milly, I have that pea-pod yet, and <em>you</em> are
beginning to wilt, but I am as plump as ever.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pshaw!” was Mildred’s scornful reply, as she hurried
on through the Park, while Hugh walked slowly
down the road, wishing he had money and could give
it all to Milly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I shall never be rich,” he said to himself, “even
if I’m a lawyer as I mean to be, for only dishonest lawyers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>make money, they say, and I sha’n’t be a cheat if I
never make a cent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile Milly had reached the house, which had
always impressed her with a good deal of awe, it was so
stately and grand. Going up to the front door she was
about to ring, when the same voice which had ordered
her from the berry pasture, said to her rather sharply:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are you doing here, little girl?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m Mildred Leach, and I’ve come to be Allie’s
little friend,” Mildred answered, facing the speaker
squarely, with her satchel in both hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes; I know, but go to the side door, and say
Miss Alice instead of Allie,” Mr. Thornton replied as he
began to puff at his cigar.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here was <em>sass</em> at the outset, and remembering her
promise to Hugh, Milly gave a vigorous pull at the bell,
saying as she did so:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I sha’n’t call her Miss, and I shall go into the front
door, or I sha’n’t stay. I ain’t dirt!”</p>

<p class='c012'>This speech was so astounding and unexpected, that
instead of resenting it, Mr. Thornton laughed aloud,
and as a servant just then came to the door, he sauntered
away, saying to himself:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Plucky, by Jove; but if she suits Allie, I don’t
care.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If Mr. Thornton had a redeeming trait it was his love
for his wife and children, especially little Alice, for
whom he would sacrifice everything, even his pride,
which is saying a great deal, and when, an hour later, he
found her in the Park with Mildred at her side making
dandelion curls for her, he was very gracious and
friendly, asking her how old she was, and giving her
numerous charges with regard to his daughter. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>he went away, while Mildred looked admiringly after
him, thinking how handsome he was in his city clothes,
and how different he was from her father.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s because he’s rich and has money. I mean to
have some, too,” she thought, and with the seeds of
ambition taking deeper and deeper root, she began her
life at Thornton Park, where she soon became a great
favorite, not only with Alice, but with Mrs. Thornton,
to whom she was almost as necessary as to Alice herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Regularly every Saturday night her three dollars
were paid to her, and as regularly every Sunday morning
she took them home, where they were very acceptable,
for Mr. Leach had not the least idea of thrift, and
his daughter’s wages tided over many an ugly gap in
the household economy. Mrs. Leach had the French
calico gown, and Charlie a pair of red shoes, and Bessie
a new white frock, and Tom a new straw hat, but for
all that they missed Mildred everywhere, she was so
helpful and willing, even when rebelling most against
her condition, and when in September Mrs. Thornton
proposed that she should go with them to New York,
Mrs. Leach refused so decidedly that the wages were
at once doubled, and six dollars a week offered in place
of three. Money was nothing to Mrs. Thornton, and as
what she set her mind upon she usually managed to get,
she succeeded in this, and when in October the family
returned to the city, Mildred went with them, very
smart in the new suit Mrs. Thornton had given her,
and very red about the eyes from the tears she had
shed when saying good-bye to her home.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I’d known I should feel this way, I believe I
wouldn’t have gone,” she had thought, as she went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>from room to room with Charlie in her arms, Bessie
holding her hand, and Tom following in the rear,
whistling “The girl I left behind me,” and trying to
seem very brave.</p>

<p class='c012'>On a bench by the brook which ran back of the house
Mildred at last sat down with Charlie in her lap, and
looking at the water running so fast at her feet, wondered
if she should ever see it again, and where Hugh
was that he did not come to say good-bye. She had a
little package for him, and when at last he appeared,
and leaping across the brook, sat down beside her, she
gave it to him, and said with a forced laugh:</p>

<p class='c012'>“A splint from the oven broom. You used to ask
for one, and here ’tis.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He knew what she meant, and opening the paper saw
one of her dark curls.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks, Milly,” he said, with a lump in his throat.
“I’ll keep it, and the peas, too, till you come back.
When will that be?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know; next summer, most likely; though
perhaps I shall stay away until I’m such a fine lady that
you won’t know me. I’m to study with Allie’s governess
and learn everything, so as to teach some time,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here’s the carriage,” Tom called round the corner,
and kissing Charlie and Bessie and Tom, who did not
resist her now, and crying on her mother’s neck, and
wringing her father’s hard hand and saying good-bye to
Hugh, she went out from the home where for many a
long year she was not seen again.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>INCIDENTS OF FIFTEEN YEARS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At first the inmates of the farm house missed the
young girl sadly; but they gradually learned to get on
very well without her, and when in the spring word came
that Mrs. Thornton was going to Europe and wished
to take Mildred with her, offering as an inducement a
sum far beyond what they knew the girl’s services were
worth, and when Mildred, too, joined her entreaties with
Mrs. Thornton’s, telling of the advantage the foreign
life would be to her, as she was to share in Alice’s
instruction, the father and mother consented, with no
thought, however, that she would not return within the
year. When Hugh heard of it he went alone into the
woods, and sitting down near the chestnut tree, where
he and Milly had often gathered the brown nuts together,
thought the matter out in his plain, practical
way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That ends it with Milly,” he said. “Europe will
turn her head, and if she ever comes home she will
despise us more than ever and me most of all, with my
gawky manners and big hands and feet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, taking from his pocket a little box, he opened
it carefully, and removing a fold of paper looked wistfully
at the contents. A curl of dark-brown hair and a
gray pod with two peas inside,—one shriveled and
harder than the other, and as it seemed to him harder
and more shriveled than when he last looked at it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s just as I thought it would be,” he said, “She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>will grow away from me with her French and German
and foreign ways, unless I grow with her,” and for the
first time in his life Hugh felt the stirring of a genuine
and laudable ambition. “<em>I</em> will make something of
myself,” he said. “I have it in me, I know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The curl and the peas were put away, and from that
time forward Hugh’s career was onward and upward,
first to school in Pittsfield, then to college at Amherst,
then to a law office in Albany, and then ten years later
back to Rocky Point, where he devoted himself to his
profession and won golden laurels as the most honorable
and prominent lawyer in all the mountain district.
Rocky Point had had a boom in the meantime, and now
spread itself over the hillside and across the pasture
land, almost to the red farm house which stood by the
running brook, its exterior a little changed, as blinds
had been added and an extra room with a bow window,
which looked toward the village and the brook. And
here on summer mornings fifteen years after Mildred
went away a pale-faced woman sat, with her hair now
white as snow, combed smoothly back from her brow,
her hands folded on her lap, and her eyes turned towards
the window through which she knew the sun was shining
brightly, although she could not see it, for Mrs.
Leach was blind. Headache and hereditary disease had
done their work, and when her husband died she could
not see his face, on which her tears fell so fast. For
more than two years he had been lying in the cemetery
up the mountain road, and beside his grave was another
and a shorter one, nearly level with the ground, for it
was twelve years since Charlie died and won the golden
crown which Milly had promised him that day when the
spirit of prophecy was upon her.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>During all these years Mildred had never come back
to the old home which bore so many proofs of her loving
remembrance, for every dollar she could spare from
her liberal allowance was sent to her people. Mrs.
Thornton had died in Paris, where Alice was so far
cured of her spinal trouble that only a slight limp told
that she had ever been lame. At the time of Mrs.
Thornton’s death there was staying in the same hotel
an English lady, a widow, who had recently lost her
only daughter, a girl about Mildred’s age, with something
of Mildred’s look in her eyes. To this lady,
whose name was Mrs. Gardner, Mildred had in her
helpful way rendered many little services and made
herself so agreeable that when Mrs. Thornton died
the lady offered to take her as her companion and possibly
adopted daughter, if the girl proved all she hoped
she might. When this proposal was made to Mr.
Thornton he neither assented nor objected. The girl
could do as she pleased, he said, and as she pleased to
go she went, sorry to leave Alice, but glad to escape
from the father, whose utter indifference and apparent
forgetfulness of her presence in his family, had chafed
and offended her. Rude he had never been to her, but
she might have been a mere machine, so far as he had
any interest in or care for her. She was simply a servant,
whose name he scarcely remembered, and of
whose family he knew very little when Mrs. Gardner
questioned him of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very poor and very common; such as would be
called peasantry on the continent,” he said, and Mildred,
who accidentally overheard the remark, felt the
hot blood stain her face and throb through her veins as
she registered a vow that this proud, cold man, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>likened her to a peasant, should some day hold a different
opinion of her.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was nearly fifteen now, and older than her years
with her besetting sin, ambition, intensified by her life
abroad, and as she saw, in the position which Mrs.
Gardner offered her an added round to the ladder she
was climbing, she took it unhesitatingly, and went with
her to Switzerland, from which place she wrote to her
mother, asking pardon if she had done wrong, and enclosing
fifty pounds which she had been saving for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Taken the bits in her teeth,” was Hugh’s comment,
when he heard of it, while Mr. and Mrs. Leach
mourned over their wayward daughter, whose loving
letters, however, and substantial gifts made some
amends for her protracted absence.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had gone with Mrs. Gardner as a companion, but
grew so rapidly into favor that the lady began at last
to call her daughter, and when she found that her
middle name was Frances, to address her as Fanny, the
name of the little girl she had lost, and to register her
as Miss Gardner. To this Mildred at first objected as
something not quite honorable, but when she saw how
much more attention Fanny Gardner received than
Mildred Leach had done, she gave up the point, and
became so accustomed to her new name that the sound
of the old would have seemed strange to her had she
heard it spoken. Of the change, however, she never
told her mother, and seldom said much of Mrs. Gardner,
except that she was kind and rich and handsome, with
many suitors for her hand, and when at last she wrote
that the lady had married a Mr. Harwood, and spoke of
her ever after as Mrs. Harwood, the name Gardner
passed in time entirely from the minds of both Mr. and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Mrs. Leach, who, being very human, began to feel a
pride in the fact that they had a daughter abroad,
who was growing into a fine lady and could speak both
German and French.</p>

<p class='c012'>From point to point Mildred traveled with the Harwoods,
passing always as Mrs. Harwood’s adopted
daughter, which she was to all intents and purposes.
And in a way she was very happy, although at times
there came over her such a longing for home that she
was half resolved to give up all her grandeur and go
back to the life she had so detested. They were at a
villa on the Rhine, not very far from Constance, when
she heard of Charlie’s death, and burying her face in
the soft grass of the terrace she sobbed as if her heart
were broken.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Charlie,” she moaned, “dead, and I not there
to see you. I never dreamed that you would die; and
I meant to do so much for you when you were older.
I wish I had never left you, Charlie, my darling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Could Mildred have had her way she would have gone
home then, but Mrs. Harwood would not permit it, and
so the years went on until in Egypt she heard of her
father’s death, and that her mother was blind. It was
Tom who wrote her the news, which he did not break
very gently, for in a way he resented his sister’s long
absence, and let her know that he did.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not that we really need you,” he wrote, “for Bessie
sees to the house, which is fixed up a good deal, thanks
to you and mother’s Uncle Silas. Did you ever hear of
him? I scarcely had until he died last year and left us
five thousand dollars, which makes us quite rich. We
have some blinds and a new room with a bay window
and a girl to do the work; so, you see, we are very fine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>but mother is always fretting for you, and more since
she was blind, lamenting that she can never see your
face again. Should we know you, I wonder? I guess
not, it is so long since you went away, thirteen years.
Why, you are twenty-six! Almost an old maid, and I
suppose an awful swell, with your French and German
and Italian. Bessie can speak French a little. She is
eighteen, and the handsomest girl you ever saw, unless
it is Alice Thornton, whose back is straight as a string.
She comes to Thornton Park every summer with Gerard,
and when she isn’t here with Bessie, Bessie is there
with her. Mr. Thornton is in town sometimes, high and
mighty as ever, with a face as black as thunder when
he sees Gerard talking French to Bessie, for it was of
him she learned it. I have been away to the Academy
several quarters, and would like to go to college, but
shall have to give that up, now father is dead. Did I
tell you I was reading law with Hugh? He is a big
man every way, stands six feet in his slippers, and head
and shoulders above every lawyer in these parts. Why,
they sometimes send for him to go to Albany to try a
suit. I used to think he was sweet on you, but he has
not mentioned you for a long time, except when mother
got blind, and then he said, ‘Milly ought to be here.’
But don’t fret; we get along well enough, and you
wouldn’t be happy with us.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Mildred read this letter she made up her mind
to go home at any cost, and would have done so, if on
her return from Naples she had not been stricken down
with a malarial fever, which kept her an invalid for
months, and when she recovered from it there had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>into her life a new excitement which absorbed every
other thought, and led finally to a result without which
this story would never have been written.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>AT THE FARM HOUSE.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was fifteen years since Milly Leach sat shelling
peas on the doorstep where now two young girls were
sitting, one listening to and the other reading a letter
which evidently excited and agitated her greatly. It
was as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Langham’s, London, May —, 18—.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Alice</span>,—You will probably be surprised to
hear that I am going to be married to a Miss Fanny Gardner,
whom I first met in Florence. She is twenty-seven
or twenty-eight, and the most beautiful woman I ever
saw, and good as she is beautiful. You are sure to like
her. The ceremony takes place at —— church in London,
and after the wedding breakfast at her mother’s
town house we shall go for a short time to Wales and
Ireland and then sail for home.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose you and Gerard are at the Park, or will
be soon, and I want you to see that everything is in
order. We shall occupy the suite of rooms on the south
side of the house instead of the east, and I’d like to have
them refurnished throughout, and will leave everything
to your good taste, only suggesting that although Miss
Gardner’s hair is rather a peculiar color,—golden brown,
some might call it,—she is not a blonde; neither is she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>a brunette; and such tints as soft French grays and
pinks will suit her better than blue. The wedding day
is fixed for June —. Shall telegraph as soon as we
reach New York, and possibly write you before.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your loving father,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>“<span class='sc'>Giles Thornton</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Oh—h,” and the girl who was listening drew a long
breath. “Oh—h! Going to be married,—to Fanny
Gardner. That’s a pretty name. She’s English, I suppose.
I guess you’ll like her;” and Bessie put her hand,
half pityingly, half caressingly upon the arm of her
friend, down whose cheeks two great tears were rolling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Alice replied; “but it is so sudden, and I’m
thinking of mother. I wonder what Gerard will say.
There he is now. Oh, Gerard,” she called, as a young
man came through the gate and seating himself upon a
lower step took Bessie’s hand in his and held it while
the bright blush on her lovely face told what he was to
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the matter, Allie?” he said to his sister.
“You look solemn as a graveyard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Papa is going to be married,” Alice replied, with a
sob.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wha—at!” and Gerard started to his feet. “Father
married! Why, he is nearly fifty years old. Let me
see,”—and taking the letter from Alice he read it aloud,
commenting as he read. “Twenty-seven or twenty-eight;
not much older than I am, for I am twenty-five;
quite too young for me to call her mother. ‘The most
beautiful woman I ever saw.’ He must be hard hit.
‘Ceremony takes place——’ Why, girls, it’s to-day!
It’s past. I congratulate you, Allie, on a stepmother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>and here’s to her health from her son;” and stooping
over Bessie he kissed her before she could remonstrate.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then Hugh McGregor came up the walk, and
taking off his straw hat wiped the perspiration from
his face, while he stood for a moment surveying the
group before him with a quizzical smile upon his lips.
Fifteen years had changed Hugh from the tall, awkward
boy of seventeen into the taller, less awkward
man of thirty-two, who, having mingled a good deal
with the world, had acquired much of the ease and
polish which such mingling brings. Handsome he
could not be called; there was too much of the rugged
Scotch in him for that, but he had something better
than beauty in his frank, honest face and kindly blue
eyes, which bespoke the man who could be trusted to
the death and never betray the trust. He, too, had
received a letter from Mr. Thornton, whose business in
Rocky Point he had in charge, and after reading it had
gone to Thornton Park with the news. Finding both
Alice and Gerard absent, he had followed on to the
farm house where he was sure they were.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see you know it,” he said, pointing to the letter in
Gerard’s hand. “I have heard from your father and
came to tell you. Did you suspect this at all?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” Alice replied; “he has never written a word of
any Miss Gardner. I wonder who she is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know,” Hugh answered slowly, while there
swept over him the same sensation he had experienced
when he first saw the name in Mr. Thornton’s letter.</p>

<p class='c012'>It did not seem quite new, and he repeated it over
and over again but did not associate it with Mildred
although she was often in his mind, more as a pleasant
memory now, perhaps, for the feelings of the man were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>not quite what the boy’s had been, and in one sense
Milly had dropped out of his life. When she first went
away, and he was in school, everything was done with
a direct reference to making of himself something of
which Milly would be proud when she came back.
But Milly had not come back, and the years had crept
on and he was a man honored among men, and in his
busy life had but little leisure for thought beyond his
business. It was seldom now that he looked at the
dark brown curl, or the little pea in the pod, hard as
a bullet, and shriveled almost to nothing. But when
he did he always thought of the summer day years
ago and the young girl on the steps and the sound of
the brook gurgling over the stones as it ran under the
little bridge. And it all came back to him now, with
news of Mr. Thornton’s bride, though why it should he
could not tell. He only knew that Milly was haunting
him that morning with strange persistency, and his first
question to Bessie was, “When did you hear from your
sister?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Last night. She is in London, or was,—but wrote
she was going on a journey and then was coming home.
I shall believe that when I see her. Mother has the letter,
and will be glad to see you,” was Bessie’s reply,
and Hugh went into the pleasant, sunny room where
the blind woman was sitting, with her hands folded on
her lap and a listening expression on her face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Hugh,” she exclaimed, “I am glad you have
come. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Straightening her widow’s cap, which was a little
awry, as deftly as a woman could have done, he sat down
beside her, while she continued, as she drew a letter
from her bosom, where she always kept Milly’s last.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>“I heard from Milly last night. I am afraid she is not
happy, but she is coming home by and by. She says so.
Read it, please.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking the letter he began to read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>London</span>, May —, 18—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“<span class='sc'>Darling Mother</span>:—I am in London, but shall not
stay long, for I am going on a journey, and it may be
weeks, if not months, before I can write you again. But
don’t worry. If anything happens to me you will know
it. I am quite well and—oh, mother, I never loved you
as I do now or needed your prayers so much. Pray for
me. I can’t pray for myself, but I’d give half my life
to put my arms around your neck and look into your
dear, blind eyes, which, if they could see, would not know
me, I am so changed. My hair fell out when I was so
sick in Naples, and is not the same color it used to be.
Everything is different. Oh, if I could see you, and I
shall in the fall, if I live.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Give my love to Tom and Bessie, and tell Hugh,——No,
don’t tell him anything. God bless you, darling
mother. Good-bye,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“<span class='sc'>Mildred F. Leach</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Hugh’s face was a study as he read this letter, which
sounded like a cry for help from an aching heart. Was
Milly unhappy, and if so, why? he asked himself as he
still held the letter with his eyes fixed upon the words
“Tell Hugh——No, don’t tell him anything.” Did they
mean that in her trouble she had for a moment turned
to him, he wondered, but quickly put that thought
aside. She had been too long silent to think of him
now; and he was content that it should be so. His liking
for her had been but a boy’s fancy for a little girl,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>he reasoned, and yet, as he held the letter in his hand,
it seemed to bring Milly very near to him, and he saw
her plainly as she looked when entering Thornton Park
that morning so long ago. “I felt I was losing her
then. I am sure of it now,” he was thinking, when Mrs.
Leach asked what he thought of Milly’s letter, and
where he supposed she was going, and what ailed her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh was Mrs. Leach’s confidant and oracle, whom
she consulted on all occasions, and Tom himself was no
kinder or tenderer in his manner to her than this big-hearted
Scotchman, who soothed and comforted her now
just as he always did, and then, without returning to the
young people by the door he went out through the long
window of Mrs. Leach’s room and off across the fields
to the woods on the mountain side, where he sat down
upon a rocky ledge to rest, wondering why the day was
so oppressive, and why the words “Tell Hugh” should
affect him so strangely, and why Mildred seemed so
near to him that once he put up his hand with a feeling
that he should touch her little hard, brown hand,
browned and hardened with the work she hated so
much. It was not often that he indulged in sentiment
of this kind, but the spell was on him, and he sat bound
by it until the whistle from the large shop had called
the workmen from their dinners. Then he arose and
went down the mountain road to his office, saying to
himself: “I wonder where she is to-day, when I am so
impressed with a sense of her nearness that I believe
she is thinking of me,” and with this comforting assurance,
Hugh was very patient and kind to the old woman
whose will he had changed a dozen times, and who
came to have it changed again, without a thought of
offering him any remuneration for his trouble.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Meantime the group by the door had been joined by
Tom, who had grown into just the kind of man Whittier’s
barefoot boy would have grown into if he had
grown at all,—a frank, sunny-faced young man, whom
every old woman and young girl liked, and whom one
young girl loved with all the intensity of her nature,
caring nothing that he was poor and one whom her
proud father would scorn as a son-in-law. They were
not exactly engaged,—for Alice said her father must be
consulted first, and they were waiting for him, while
Gerard, who could wait for nothing where Bessie was
concerned, was drinking his fill of love in her blue eyes,
with no thought or care as to whether his father would
oppose him or not.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello, you are all here,” Tom said, as he came
round the corner and laid his hand on Allie’s shoulder;
then, glancing at her face, he continued: “Why, you’ve
been crying. What’s the matter, Allie?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Tom, papa is married to-day,—to Fanny Gardner,
an English girl with golden-brown hair and only
twenty-eight years old and very handsome, he says. I
know I shall hate her,” Alice sobbed, while Tom burst
into a merry laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your father married to a girl with golden-brown
hair, which should be gray to match his,—that is a
shame, by Jove. But, I say, Allie, I’m glad of it, for
with a young wife at Thornton Park, you will be <i><span lang="fr">de trop</span></i>,
don’t you see?” And just as Gerard had done to Bessie
so Tom did to Alice—kissed her pale face, with his
best wishes to the bride, who was discussed pretty
freely, from her name to the furniture of her room,
which was to harmonize with the complexion of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>who was neither a blond nor a brunette, but very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the next few weeks there was a great deal of
bustle and excitement at Thornton Park, where Bessie
went every day to talk over and assist in the arrangement
of the bridal rooms, which were just completed
when there came a telegram from New York saying
that the newly married pair had arrived and would be
home the following day.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>THE BRIDE.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>A Cunard steamer had landed its living freight at
the wharf, where there was the usual scramble and confusion,
as trunks and boxes were opened and angry, excited
women confronted with their spoils by relentless
custom house officers, bent upon doing their duty, unless
stopped by the means so frequently employed upon
such occasions. Outside the long building stood an
open carriage in which a lady sat, very simply but elegantly
attired, with money, and Paris, and Worth showing
in every article of her dress, from her round hat to
her dainty boots, which could not be called small, for
the feet they covered harmonized with the lady herself,
who was tall and well proportioned, with a splendidly
developed figure, on which anything looked well. There
was a brilliant color in her cheeks, and her brown eyes
were large and bright and beautiful, but very sad as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>they looked upon the scenes around her without seeming
to see anything. Nor did their expression change
when she was joined by an elderly man, who, taking
his seat beside her, said first to the driver:</p>

<p class='c012'>“To the Windsor,” and then to her, “I was longer
than I thought I should be; those rascally officers gave
me a world of trouble, but we shall soon be at the hotel
now. Are you very tired?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The question was asked very tenderly, for Giles
Thornton was greatly in love with his bride of a few
weeks. He had first met her in Florence, where she
was recovering from the long illness which had lasted
for months and made her weak as a child and almost as
helpless. During her sickness her hair had fallen out,
and owing to some unusual freak of nature it had come in
much lighter than it was before and not so curly, although
it still lay in wavy masses upon her head, and
here and there coiled itself into rings around her forehead.
The Harwoods were staying at the same hotel
with Mr. Thornton, and it was in the Boboli Gardens
that he first met her as she was being wheeled in an
invalid chair by her attendant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will he know me?” was her first thought when he
was presented to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>But there was no fear of that, for Mildred Leach had
passed as wholly out of his mind as if he had never
seen her, and if she had not there was no danger of his
recognizing the girl who had been his daughter’s companion
in this lovely woman whose voice and manner
and appearance were indicative of the refinement and
cultivation to which for years she had been accustomed.
To him she was Miss Gardner, an English girl, and
during the half hour he walked by her chair in the gardens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>he felt his heart throb as it had never throbbed
since he buried his wife. He had loved her devotedly
and had never thought to fill her place until now when
love did its work at first sight, and when two weeks
later the Harwoods left Florence for Venice and Switzerland,
he was with them, to all intents and purposes
Mildred’s lover, although he had not openly announced
himself as such.</p>

<p class='c012'>To Mrs. Harwood Mildred had said, “Don’t tell him
who I am. I prefer to do that when the time comes.
I am going to punish him for calling my father a peasant
when you inquired about him. I heard him. I
have not forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so Mr. Thornton went blindly to his fate, which
came one day in Ouchy in the grounds of the Beau-Rivage, where Mildred was sitting alone, with her eyes
fixed upon the lake and the mountains beyond, and her
thoughts back in the old farm house, with her mother
and Bessie and Tom and Hugh, of whom she had not
heard a word for months.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He has forgotten me,” she said to herself, “and
why shouldn’t he? I was never much to him, and
yet”——</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not get any farther, for there was a footstep
near; some one was coming, and in a moment Mr.
Thornton said to her, “Alone, Miss Gardner, and
dreaming? May I dispel the dream and sit beside you
a moment?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred knew then what was before her, as well as
she did half an hour later, during which time Giles
Thornton had laid himself and his fortune at her feet,
and what was harder than all to meet, had made her believe
that he loved her. She knew that he admired her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>but she had not counted upon his love, which moved
her a little, for Mr. Thornton was not a man to whom
one could listen quietly when he was in earnest and resolved
to carry his point, and for an instant Mildred
wavered. It was something to be Mrs. Giles Thornton,
of Thornton Park, and ought to satisfy her ambition.
With all her beauty and social advantages, she as yet
had received no eligible offer. It was known that she
had no money, and only an Italian count and the youngest
son of an English earl had asked her hand in marriage.
But both were poor, and one almost an imbecile,
from whom she shrank in disgust. Mr. Thornton was
different; he was a gentleman of wealth and position,
and as his wife she would for a part of the year live
near her family. But with the thought of them there
came the memory of an overgrown, awkward boy,
whose feet and hands were so big that he never knew
what to do with them, but whose heart was so much
bigger than his feet and hands, that it bore down the
scale and Mr. Thornton’s chance was lost for the time
being.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hugh may never be anything to me,” she thought,
“but I must see him before I give myself to any one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then turning to Mr. Thornton, she said, “I thank
you for your offer, which I believe is sincere, and that
makes it harder for me to tell you what I must. Do
you remember a girl, Mildred Leach, who was your
daughter’s little friend, as she called herself, for she
was as proud as you, and would not be a maid?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ye-es,” Mr. Thornton stammered, as he looked
wistfully into the beautiful face confronting him so
steadily. “I had forgotten her entirely, but I remember
now. She left us to go with an English lady, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Mrs. Gardner. Why, that is Mrs. Harwood,—and,—and,—oh,
you are not she!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I am,” was Mildred’s reply, and then very
rapidly she told her story, not omitting her having overheard
him liken her parents to peasants when speaking
of them to Mrs. Gardner. “I determined then,” she
said, “that if possible I would one day humble your
pride, but if I have done so, it has not given me the
satisfaction I thought it would, and I am sorry to cause
you pain, for I believe you were in earnest when you
asked me to be your wife, which I can never be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” he answered slowly, like one who had received
a blow from which he could not at once recover. “No,
you can never be my wife; Mildred Leach; it does not
seem possible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then he arose and walked rapidly away, and when
the evening boat left Ouchy for Geneva he was on it,
going he cared but little where, if by going he could
forget the past as connected with Mildred Leach.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot marry her family,” he said many times during
the next few months, when he was wandering everywhere
and vainly trying to forget her, for always before
him was the face he had never admired so much as
when he last saw it, flushed and pale by turns, with a
wondrous light in the brown eyes where tears were
gathering. “If it were not for her family, or if I could
separate her from them, I would <em>not</em> give her up,” he
had often thought when in the following May he met
her again at the Grand Hotel in Paris, where the Harwoods
were stopping.</p>

<p class='c012'>He could not tell what it was which impressed him
with the idea that she had changed her mind, as she
came forward to meet him, saying she was glad to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>him, and adding that Mr. and Mrs. Harwood had gone
to the opera. She seemed very quiet and absent
minded at first, and then rousing herself, said to him
abruptly, “You did not stop long enough in Ouchy for
me to inquire after my family. You must have seen
them often since I left home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,—no,” he answered in some embarrassment;
“I have of course been to Thornton Park, but I do not
remember much about them. I believe your father
rents, or did rent, some land of me, but am not sure, as
my agent attends to all that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My father is dead,” Mildred answered so sharply as
to make him jump and color painfully, as if guilty of a
misdemeanor in not knowing that her father was dead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I beg your pardon. I am very sorry. I,—yes,—am
very sorry,” he began; but she cut him short by saying,
“Do you know Hugh McGregor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes. I know him well,” and Mr. Thornton
brightened perceptibly. “He is my lawyer, and attends
to all my business in Rocky Point; a fine fellow,—a
very fine fellow. Do you know him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mildred replied, while her breath came heavily,
“I know him, and I hear he is to marry my sister
Bessie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, indeed,” and as if memory had suddenly come
back to him, Mr. Thornton seemed immensely relieved.
“I remember now,—Bessie Leach; that’s the girl I
have sometimes seen with Alice. Gerard taught her
French,—a very pretty girl. And Mr. McGregor is engaged
to her? I am very glad. Any girl might be
proud to marry him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred made no reply to this, and Mr. Thornton
never guessed the dreary emptiness of her soul as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>sat with her hands clasped tightly together, thinking of
the man whom any girl would be proud to marry. A
few months before she would have said that he was
nothing more to her than the friend of her childhood,
but she had recently learned her mistake, and that
the thought of seeing him again was one of the pleasantest
anticipations of her home going. There had
come to the hotel a Mr. and Mrs. Hayford from America,
who sometimes spent their summers at Rocky
Point, where Mrs. Hayford was once a teacher. As
Mildred had been her pupil, she remembered her at
once, after hearing the name, and would have introduced
herself but for a conversation accidentally overheard
between Mrs. Hayford and a friend who had also
been at Rocky Point, and to whom she was retailing
the news, first of New York and then of Rocky Point,
where she had spent a few days in April prior to sailing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you remember that Hercules of a lawyer, Hugh
McGregor, whom you admired so much?” was asked.
“They say he is engaged to Bessie Leach, a girl much
younger than himself, but very pretty,—beautiful, in
fact, and——</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred heard no more, but hurried away, with an
ache in her heart that she could not quite define. Tom
had intimated that Gerard was interested in Bessie, and
now Hugh was engaged to her. Well, it was all right,
she said, and would not admit to herself how hard the
blow had struck her and how she smarted under it.
And it was just when the smart was at its keenest that
Mr. Thornton came again across her path, more in love,
if possible, than ever, and more intent upon making her
his wife. He had fought a desperate battle with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>pride and had conquered it, and within twenty-four hours
after meeting her in Paris, she had promised to marry
him, and when her pledge was given she was conscious
of a feeling of quiet and content which she had scarcely
hoped for. In his character as lover Mr. Thornton did
not seem at all like the man she had feared in her
childhood, nor if he felt it did he gave the slightest
sign that he was stooping from his high position. She
had been very frank with him and had made no pretension
of love. “I will be true to you,” she said, “and
try to please you in everything. I am tired of the aimless
life I have led so many years, and I think Mrs.
Harwood is a little tired of me too. She says I ought
to have married long ago, but I could not marry a fool
even if he had a title. I shall be so glad to go home to
my friends, although I am so changed they will never
know me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she added laughingly: “Wouldn’t it be great
fun not to write them who I am and see if they will
recognize me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not really mean what she said, or guess that
it harmonized perfectly with a plan which Mr. Thornton
had in mind, and was resolved to carry out, if possible.
If he could have had his wish he would not have gone
to Rocky Point at all, but his children were there and
Mildred’s heart was set upon it, and he must meet the
difficulty in some way. He could marry Mildred, but
not her family, and he shrank from the intimacy which
must necessarily exist between the Park and the farm
house when it was known who his wife was. In his
estimation the Leaches were nobodies, and he could not
have them running in and out of his house and treating
him with the familiarity of a son and brother, as he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>sure they would do if he did not stop it. If Mildred
would consent to remain incognito while at the Park
the annoyance would be prevented, and this consent
he tried to gain by many specious arguments. His
real reason, he knew, must be kept from sight, and so
he asked it as a personal favor, saying it would please
him very much and be a kind of excitement for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Possibly you will be recognized,” he said; “and if
so, all right; if not, we will tell them just before we
go to New York in the autumn and enjoy their surprise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He did not add that, once away from Rocky Point, it
would probably be long before he took her there again.
He only talked of the plan as a joke, which Mildred did
not quite see. She was willing to keep the secret until
she met them, but to keep it longer was absurd and
foolish, she said, and involved a deception, which she
abhorred.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I accepted you partly that I might be near them
and see them every day,” she said, “and am longing to
throw my arms around mother’s neck and tell her I have
come back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so you shall in time, but humor my whim for
once. You will not be sorry,” Mr. Thornton pleaded,
and Mildred consented at last, and felt in a measure
repaid when she saw how happy it made Mr. Thornton,
whose real motive she did not guess.</p>

<p class='c012'>This was the last of April, and six weeks later Mildred
was Mrs. Giles Thornton, traveling through Scotland
and Wales and trying to believe herself happy in
her husband’s love and the costly gifts he lavished
upon her. She had been courted and admired as Fanny
Gardner, but the deference paid her now and her independence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>were very sweet to her, and if she could have
forgotten Hugh and been permitted to make herself
known to her family, she would have been content at
least on the morning when she left New York and
started for Thornton Park.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. GILES THORNTON.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>She was very lovely in all the fullness of her matured
beauty as she stepped from the train at Rocky Point,
and with her large bright eyes swept the crowd of
curious people gathered to see her, not one of whom
she recognized. A handsome open carriage from Brewster’s,
sent up a few days before for this occasion, was
waiting for them, and with a half bow to those who
ventured to salute her husband, Mildred seated herself
in it and was driven through the well-remembered
street, her heart beating so loudly that she could hear
it distinctly as she drew near the top of the hill from
which she knew she would see her old home and possibly
her mother. And when the hill top was reached
and she saw the house with its doors opened wide, and
from the upper window of what had been hers and
Bessie’s room a muslin curtain blowing in and out, she
grew so white that her husband laid his hand on hers,
and said, “Don’t take it so hard, darling. You are doing
it to please me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but it seems as if I must stop here,” she answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>faintly as she leaned forward to look at the house
around which there was no sign of life, or stir, except
the moving of the curtain and the gambols of two kittens
playing in the doorway where Mildred half expected
to meet the glance of Bessie’s blue eyes and see
the gleam of Charlie’s golden hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Charlie was lying on the mountain side, and
Bessie, although out of sight, was watching the carriage
and the beautiful stranger in whom she saw no trace of
her sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve seen her,” Bessie said, as she went into her
mother’s room, “and she is very lovely, with such a
bright color on her cheeks. And so young to be Mr.
Thornton’s wife! I wonder if she loves him. I
couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. I suppose you prefer Gerard,” Mrs. Leach replied,
while Bessie answered blushingly, “Of course I
do. Poor Gerard! How angry his father will be when
he knows about Tom and me, too. Gerard was going
to tell him at once, but I persuaded him to wait until
the honeymoon was over. Just two months I’ll give
him, and during that time I mean to cultivate Mrs.
Thornton and get her on my side. I hope she is not
proud like him. She did not look so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bessie had been at the Park that morning helping
Alice give the last touches to the rooms intended for
the bride. These had been finished in the tints which
Mr. Thornton had prescribed. Everything was new,
from the carpets on the floors to the lace-canopied bedstead
of brass. There were flowers everywhere in great
profusion, roses mostly of every variety, and in a glass
on a bracket in a corner, Bessie had put a bunch of
June pinks from her own garden, explaining to Alice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>that her mother had sent them to the bride, as they
were her favorite flowers and would make the rooms so
sweet. Everything was finished at last, and after
Bessie was gone Alice had nothing to do but to wait
for the coming of the carriage which she soon saw entering
the Park. Mildred’s face was very white and her
voice trembled as she saw Alice in the distance and
said, “I can’t bear it. I came near shrieking to the old
home that I was Mildred. I must tell Alice. I cannot
be so hypocritical. There is no reason for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no,” and Mr. Thornton spoke a little sternly.
“It is too late now, and you have promised. I wish it
and have my reason. Ah, here we are, and there are
Alice and Gerard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They had stopped under the great archway at the
side entrance where Gerard and Alice were waiting for
them and scanning the bride curiously as she alighted
and their father presented her to them,—not as their
mother, but as “Mrs. Thornton, my wife.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All Mildred’s color had come back and her face was
glowing with excitement as she took Alice’s hand; then
unable to control herself, she threw her arms around
the neck of the astonished girl and burst into a flood of
tears, while Mr. Thornton looked on in dismay, dreading
what might follow. He was himself beginning to
think it a very foolish and unnatural thing to try to
keep his wife’s identity from her people, but he was not
a man to give up easily, and once in a dilemma of his
own making he would stay in it at any cost.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is very tired and must go to her room,” he said
to his daughter, who was crying herself, and holding
Mildred’s hands in her own.</p>

<p class='c012'>Had Mildred tried she could have done nothing better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>for her cause than she had done. Alice had been
very doubtful as to whether she should like her new
mother or not, but something in the eyes which looked
so appealingly into hers, and in the tears she felt upon
her cheek, and the clasp of the arms around the neck,
disarmed all prejudice and made of her a friend at
once. As for Gerard, he had never meant to be anything
but friendly, and when the scene between the two
ladies was over he came forward with the slow, quiet
manner natural to him and said, “Now it is my turn to
welcome Mrs. Thornton, who does not look as if she
could have for a son a great six-footer like me. But I’ll
call you mother, if you say so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, don’t,” Mildred answered, flashing on him a
smile which made his heart beat rapidly and brought a
thought of Bessie, who sometimes smiled like that.</p>

<p class='c012'>Leading the way to Mildred’s rooms, Alice said, as
she threw open the door, “I hope you will like them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Like them! They are perfect,” was Mildred’s
answer, as she walked through the apartments, feeling
that it must be a dream from which she would bye-and-bye
awaken. “And so many roses,” she said, stopping
here and there over a bowl or cluster of them until,
guided by the perfume, she came upon the pinks her
mother had sent to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking up the glass she held it for an instant while
Alice said, “June pinks, perhaps you do not have them
in England. They are old-fashioned flowers, but very
sweet. A friend of mine, Bessie Leach, brought them
for you from her mother, who is blind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a low cry and a crash as the finger-glass
fell to the floor and Mildred sank into the nearest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>chair, white as ashes, with a look in her eyes which
startled and frightened Alice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the heat and fatigue of the voyage. I was very
sea-sick,” Mildred said, trying to smile and recover herself,
while Alice went for a towel to wipe up the water
trickling over the carpet, and wondering if Mrs.
Thornton was given to faintings and hysterics like
this.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She don’t look like it,” she thought, as she picked
up and carried out the bits of glass and the pinks which
had done the mischief.</p>

<p class='c012'>When lunch was served Mildred was too ill to go
down. A severe headache had come on, and for a time
Alice sat by her couch bathing her forehead and brushing
her hair, which was more a mottled than golden
brown, for it was darker in some places than others, especially
when seen in certain lights and shadows. But
this only added to its beauty, and Alice ran her fingers
through the shining mass, admiring the color and the
texture and admiring the woman generally and answering
the many questions which were asked her.
Hungry at heart to hear something of her family,
Mildred said to her, “Tell me of your friends. Have
you any here? Girl friends, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only one with whom I am intimate,” Alice replied,
and then as girls will she went off into rhapsodies over
Bessie Leach, and in a burst of confidence concluded
by saying, “You must not tell papa, for he is not to
know it yet, but Bessie is to be my sister. She is to
marry Gerard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Marry Gerard!” and Mildred raised herself upon
her elbow and shedding her heavy hair back from her
face stared at Alice with an expression in her eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>which the girl could not understand, and which made
her wonder if her stepmother, too, were as proud as
her father and would resent Gerard’s choice.</p>

<p class='c012'>This called forth another eulogy upon Bessie’s beauty
and sweetness, with many injunctions that Mildred
should not repeat to her husband what had been told
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nobody knows it for certain but Mr. McGregor and
ourselves,” she added, and then, turning her face away
so that it could not be seen, Mildred said, “Mr. McGregor?
That is your father’s attorney. Is he a
married man?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The question was a singular one, but Alice was not
quick to suspect, and answered laughingly, “Hugh
McGregor married! Why, I don’t suppose he has ever
looked twice at any girl. He is a confirmed old
bachelor, but very nice. Father thinks the world of
him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, oh, yes,” Mildred moaned, as she clasped her
hands over her forehead where the pain was so intense.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are worse. You are white as a sheet; let me
call papa,” Alice cried, alarmed at the look of anguish
in the dark eyes and the gray pallor of the face which
seemed to have grown pinched and thin in a moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>But her husband was the last person whom Mildred
wished to see then, and detaining Alice she said, “Don’t
call him, please. It will soon pass off, and don’t think
me ungrateful, either, but I’d rather be alone for a while.
I may sleep and that will do me good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so, after darkening the room, Alice went out
and left the wretched woman alone in her grief and
pain.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Hayford was mistaken. Hugh is not engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>to Bessie, and I am Mrs. Giles Thornton,” she said, a
little bitterly. “My ambition ought to be satisfied. I
have made my own bed and must lie in it, and go on lying,
too!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She smiled faintly at her own joke and then continued:
“If I had only resisted and come back Mildred
Leach! But it is now too late, and Hugh will
always despise me for the deception. Oh, Hugh!”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a spasmodic wringing of the hands, and
then, as if ashamed of herself Mildred said, “I must
not, will not be faithless to my husband, who loves me,
I know, and I will be worthy of his love and make him
happy, so help me Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The vow was made and Mildred would keep it to the
death. The might have been, which has broken so
many hearts when the knowledge came too late, was
put away and buried deep down in the inmost recesses
of her soul, and when two hours later she awoke from a
refreshing sleep and found her husband sitting by her,
she put her hand in his just as she had never put it before,
and did not shrink from him when he stooped down
to caress her.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='large'>CALLS AT THE PARK.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was early the next morning when Mildred arose
and stepping out upon the balcony looked toward the
town which had changed so much since she was there
last. Across the noisy little river which went dashing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>along in its rocky bed at the foot of the mountain, one
or two tall stacks of manufactories were belching forth
their smoke, while new churches and hotels and villas
dotted what had been pasture lands when she went
away. Standing upon tiptoe she could see the chimney
top of her old home, and just over it, up the mountain
road, the evergreens in the cemetery where her father
and Charlie were lying.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll go there some day alone and find their graves,”
she was thinking when her husband joined her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am sure you are better, you look so fresh and
bright; but it is time you were getting ready for breakfast,”
he said, as he gave her a little caress.</p>

<p class='c012'>And Mildred was very bright when she at last went
with her husband to the breakfast-room, a half-opened
rose which he had gathered for her at her throat, and
another at her belt. It was her first appearance at her
own table, and Mr. Thornton led her proudly to her
seat behind the coffee urn and looked at her admiringly
while she assumed the rôle of mistress as naturally as if
she had all her life been accustomed to her present surroundings.
Alice had kissed her effusively as she came
in, hoping she was quite well and thinking her more
beautiful than on the previous day. Gerard, who was
less demonstrative but more observant than his sister,
greeted her cordially and then sat watching her,
curious and puzzled by something in her face or
manner or voice which seemed familiar to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is dazzlingly lovely. I wonder how Bessie will
look beside her,” he thought, as after breakfast he
started for the farm house as was his daily custom.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was very warm that morning and Mildred had
seated herself with a book upon the shaded balcony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>opening from her room, when word was brought her
that her husband wished to see her on the front piazza.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s a gentleman with him,—Mr. McGregor,” the
servant said, and Mildred felt as if her heart had suddenly
risen in her throat, making her choke and gasp
for breath.</p>

<p class='c012'>She knew he would come some time, but had not expected
him so soon, and she shook like a leaf as she
stood a moment before her mirror.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He will never know me,” she said, as side by side
with the reflection of herself she saw the girl of fifteen
years ago; sallow and thin and slight, with eyes too big
for her face, and hair too heavy for her head; the girl
with the faded calico dress and high-necked apron,
who seemed to walk beside her as she descended the
broad staircase and went through the hall and out upon
the piazza, where she heard her husband’s voice, and
Hugh’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I came on business, and intended calling later, but
I shall be glad to see Mrs. Thornton,” she heard him
say, and then the smothered, choking sensation left her,
and, with a little unconscious nod to the other Mildred
at her side, she whispered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall pull through.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh was standing half-way down the piazza, leaning
against a column, with his straw hat in his hand,
fanning himself, just as she had seen him do a hundred
times when they were boy and girl together, and he
was looking at the shadowy Mildred at her side just as
he now looked at her, the tall, elegant, perfectly self-possessed
woman, coming slowly towards him, every
movement graceful, and every action that of one sure
pf herself, and accustomed to the admiration she saw in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>his eyes,—the same kind, honest blue eyes which she
remembered so well, but which had in them no sign of
recognition as he came forward to meet her, and offering
her his hand, welcomed her to Rocky Point, “and
America,” he added, while a blood-red stain crept up
from her neck to her ear as she felt the deception she
was allowing. Hugh was not as polished as Mr. Thornton,
nor were his clothes as faultless and fashionable,
but he was every whit a gentleman, and looked it, too,
as he stood for a moment talking to Mildred in the
voice she knew so well and which had grown richer and
deeper with the lapse of time, and moved her strangely
as she listened to it again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think I should have known him anywhere,” she
thought, as she answered his remarks, her own voice, in
which the English accent was predominant, steady and
firm, but having in it occasionally a tone which made
Hugh start a little, it was so like something he had
heard before, but could not define.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was nothing in this English woman, as he believed
her to be, which could remind him of Mildred
Leach, who was never once in his mind during the few
minutes he was talking with her. And still she puzzled
him, and all that morning, after his return to his
office, her lovely face and especially her eyes haunted
him and looked at him from every paper and book he
touched, and he heard the tone, which had struck him
as familiar, calling to him everywhere, and bringing at
last a thought of Mildred Leach and the July morning
when she had shelled her peas by the door, and given
him a pod as a souvenir. Where was she now, he wondered,
and would she come back in the autumn? Probably
not. She had held out similar promises before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>only to break them. She was weaned entirely from all
her old associations, and it did not matter, he said to
himself, wondering, as he often did, why he had so long
kept in his mind the little wayward girl, who had never
done anything but tease and worry him, and tell him of
the great things she meant to do.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She has been a long time doing it, unless she calls
a life of dependence a great thing,” he said, and then
his thoughts drifted to Thornton Park and the bride,
who was troubled with no more calls that day, and so
had time to rest and go about her handsome house and
grounds, much handsomer than when she first rang
the front door bell and was told to go to the side entrance
by the man who was her husband now, and
prouder of her than of all his other surroundings.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next day there were many visitors at the Park,
mostly strangers to Mildred, although a few of them had
been known to her in childhood, but like Hugh, they
saw no resemblance in her to the “oldest Leach girl,”
as she was called by the neighbors who remembered
her. Of the bride there was but one verdict, “The most
elegant and agreeable woman that has ever been in
Rocky Point,” was said of her by all, for Mildred, while
bearing herself like a princess, was so gracious and
friendly that she took every heart by storm.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was late in the day when Bessie started to make
her call with Tom. Dinner was over and Mildred, who,
with her husband and Gerard and Alice, was sitting
upon the piazza, saw them as they turned an angle in
the shrubbery and came up the avenue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, there’s Bessie,” Allie cried, springing to her
feet, while Mildred’s heart began to beat wildly as she
glanced at Mr. Thornton, on whose brow there was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>dark frown, the first she had seen since she was his
wife, and this quieted her at once, for she readily
guessed its cause. She knew he had not married her
family, and had begun to suspect that he meant to keep
her from them as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But he cannot do it,” she thought, and turning to
him she said in a low tone, “They are mine; my own
flesh and blood, and for my sake treat them politely.
It is the first favor I have asked of you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was something in her eyes which made him
think she might be dangerous if roused, and for aught
he knew she might bring the whole family there to live,
or leave him for them, and swallowing his pride, he
went forward to meet his visitors with so much cordiality
that Tom, who had never received the slightest
civility from the great man, thought, to himself, “By
Jove, she’s made him over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My wife, Mrs. Thornton; Miss Leach and Mr.
Leach,” Mr. Thornton said, and Mildred’s hand, cold
and nerveless, was taken by a hand as white and soft as
her own, while Bessie’s blue eyes looked curiously at
her, and Bessie was saying the commonplace things
which strangers say to each other.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How lovely she is,” Mildred thought, hardly able to
restrain herself from folding the sunny, bright-faced
girl in her arms and sobbing and crying over her.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Tom was speaking to her now, and she was conscious
of a feeling of pride as she looked at the tall,
handsome, manly fellow, and knew he was her brother.
Tom was like his mother, and Bessie like her father,
while Mildred was like neither, and one could scarcely
have seen any resemblance between them as they sat
talking together until the moon came up over the hill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>and it was time to go. Bessie had devoted herself to
Mildred, who fascinated her greatly, and who had
adroitly led her to talk of herself and her home and her
mother. Mildred spoke of the pinks, her voice trembling
as she sent her thanks and love to the blind woman
whom she was soon coming to see.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I’m so glad,” Bessie exclaimed, in her impulsive
way, “and mother will be glad too. She sent the pinks
because they are her favorite flowers and she says they
remind her of Milly, who used to love them so much;
that’s my sister, who has been abroad many years. I
scarcely remember her at all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh,” came like a moan from Mildred, who felt as if
a blow had struck her heart, it throbbed so painfully at
the mention of her old name by the sister who did not
know her, and for an instant she was tempted to
scream out the truth and bring the foolish farce to an
end.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she felt her husband’s hand on her arm and
the power of his will overmastering her, and keeping
her quiet. But she was glad when the interview was
over and she was free to go by herself and sob out her
anguish and shame and regret, that she had ever lent
herself to this deception. Of the two, Bessie and Tom,
she had felt more drawn toward the latter, of whom any
sister might be proud, and when bidding him good-night
she had held his hand with a pressure which surprised
him, while her lips quivered and her eyes had in
them a wistful look, as if she were longing to say, “Oh,
Tom; my brother.” And Tom had felt the magnetism
of her eyes and manner, and he said to Alice, who, with
Gerard, walked with them to the Park gate, “I say,
Allie, your stepmother is a stunner, and no mistake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>and I do believe she took a fancy to me. Why, I
actually thought she squeezed my hand a little, and she
looked as if she’d like to kiss me. It wouldn’t hurt me
much to kiss her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Tom; and right before Allie,” Bessie said
laughingly, and Tom replied, “Can’t a fellow fall in
love with his stepmother-in-law, if he wants to?” and
the arm he had thrown around Alice tightened its hold
upon her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here they all laughed together and went on freely
discussing the woman, who, on her knees in her room
was praying to be forgiven for the lie she was living,
and for strength to meet her mother, as that would be
the hardest ordeal of all. Once she resolved to defy
her husband and proclaim her identity, but gave that
up with the thought that it was not very long until September,
and she would wait at least until she had seen
her mother.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>MILDRED AND HER MOTHER.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was several days before Mildred went to the farm
house, from which her husband would have kept her
altogether if he could have done so. His determination
to separate her as much as possible from her family had
been constantly increasing since his return, and he had
fully made up his mind to leave Rocky Point by the
first of September and advertise the Park for sale, thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>cutting off all chance for intimacy in the future when it
was known who she was. She could do for her family
all she pleased, he thought, but she must not be intimate
with them, and on his way to the house, for he
drove her there himself, he reminded her again of her
promise, saying to her very kindly, as he helped her to
alight:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can trust you, Milly, and am sorry for you, for I
know it will be hard to meet your mother and keep
silence.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was harder than Mildred herself had anticipated,
for the sight of the familiar place, the walk, the garden,
and the brook, where she had waded barefoot many a
time in summer and drawn her sled in winter with
Hugh at her side, nearly unmanned her, and every nerve
was quivering as she rang the bell in the door of the
little, square entry, with the steep, narrow stairs winding
up to the chambers above. It was Bessie who answered
the ring, blushing when she saw her visitor and apologizing
for her appearance. The hired girl was gone for
a day or two, leaving her maid of all work, and as this
was baking day she was deep in the mysteries of pastry
and bread, with her long, bib apron on and her hands
covered with flour.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never mind me,” Mildred said, as she took in the
situation. “It was thoughtless in me to come in the
morning. Please keep to your work while I talk with
your mother. I will call upon you some other time.
Oh, Gerard, you here?” she continued, as through the
door opening into the kitchen she saw the young man
seated by the table pitting cherries which Bessie was
to make into pies. “That’s right; help all you can,”
she added with a smile, glad he was there, as it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>leave her alone and freer with her mother, whom she
found in the bright, sunny room, built partly with the
money she had sent.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Leach was always very neat and clean, but this
morning she was particularly so, in her black cambric
dress and spotless white apron, with the widow’s
cap resting on her snowy hair. Her hands were folded
together, and she was leaning back in her chair as if
asleep, when Mildred’s voice roused her, and a moment
after Bessie said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here, mother, is Mrs. Thornton, and as I am so busy
I will leave her with you for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly, as if she had been shot, Mrs. Leach started
forward, and rubbing her eyes, in which there was an
eager, expectant look, said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must have been dozing, for I dreamed that Milly
had come and I heard her voice in the kitchen. Mis’
Thornton here, did you say? I am very proud to meet
her;” and the hands were outstretched, groping in the
helpless way habitual with the blind. And Mildred
took the hands in hers and drawing a chair to her
mother’s side sat down so close to her that Mrs. Leach
felt her hot breath stir her hair and knew she was being
looked at very closely. But how closely she did not
dream, for Mildred’s soul was in her eyes, which scanned
the worn face where suffering and sorrow had left their
impress. And what a sad, sweet face it was, so sweet
and sad that Mildred involuntarily took it between her
hands and kissed it passionately; then, unable to control
herself, she laid her head on her mother’s bosom
and sobbed like a little child.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it? Oh, Mrs. Thornton, you scare me.
What makes you cry so? Who are you?” Mrs. Leach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>said, excitedly, for she was frightened by the strange
conduct of her visitor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must excuse me,” Mildred said, lifting up her
head. “The sight of you unnerved me, for my,—my
mother is blind?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not at all mean to say what she knew would
involve more deception of a certain kind, but she had
said it and could not take it back, and it was a sufficient
explanation of her emotion to Mrs. Leach, who said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your mother blind! Dear,—dear,—how did it happen,
and has she been so long? Where does she live,
and how could she bear to have you leave her? Dear,
dear!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t talk of her now, please. I can’t bear it,” Mildred
replied, and thinking to herself, “Homesick, poor
thing,” Mrs. Leach, whose ideas of the world were narrowed
to her own immediate surroundings, began to
talk of herself and her family in a desultory kind of
way, while Mildred listened with a feeling of half wonder,
half pain.</p>

<p class='c012'>All her associations while with Mrs. Harwood had
been with highly-cultivated people, and in one sense her
mother was new to her and she realized as she had never
done before how different she was from Mr. Thornton
and herself. “But she is my mother, and nothing can
change my love for her,” she thought, as she studied
her and the room, which was cozy and bright, though
very plainly furnished as compared with the elegant
boudoir where she had made her own toilet. There
was the tall clock in the corner which had ticked away
the hours and days she once thought so dreary and
lonely; the desk between the windows, where her
father used to keep his papers, and his old, worn pocketbook,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>in which there was never much money, and on
the bed in another corner was a patchwork quilt, a few
blocks of which Mildred had pieced herself, recognizing
them now with a start and a throb of pain as she saw in
two of them bits of the frock she had bought for Charlie
with the berries picked in her husband’s pasture. She
had been turned out then as a trespasser where she was
mistress now, and there were diamonds on her white
hands, which had once washed potatoes for dinner, her
special abomination, and her gown had cost more than
all her mother’s wardrobe. And there she sat in a kind
of dream, while the other Mildred of years ago sat close
beside her, confusing and bewildering her, so that she
hardly heard half her mother was saying about Tom
and Bessie, the dearest children in the world. But
when at last her own name was mentioned she started
and was herself again, and listened as her mother
went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve another girl, Mildred by name, but I call her
Milly. She’s been in Europe for years, and has been
everywhere and speaks French and German, and writes
such beautiful letters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was evidently very proud of her absent daughter,
and the lady beside her, whose pallid face she could not
see, clasped her hands and held her breath as she continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never s’posed she’d stay so long when she went
away, or I couldn’t let her go; but somehow or other
she’s staid on and on till she’s been gone many a year;
many a year has Milly been gone, fifteen years come
fall, and now ‘tain’t likely I should know her, if I could
see. You won’t be offended, Mis’ Thornton, if I say that
something about you makes me think of Milly; something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>in your voice at first, and you laid your head on
my neck and cried just as she used to when things
went wrong and fretted her, which they mostly did, for
she wasn’t meant to be poor, and was always wantin’ to
be rich and grand. I guess she is grand now she’s been
in foreign places so much, but she’s comin’ home in the
fall; she wrote me so in her last letter. You’ll call on
her, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mildred stammered, scarcely able to keep herself
from crying out: “Oh, mother, I <em>have</em> come. I
am Milly,” but a thought of her husband restrained
her, and thinking how she would make amends in the
future, when freed from her promise of secrecy, she listened
again, while her mother talked of her father and
Charlie, and lastly of Hugh McGregor, who was a great
favorite with the old lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Jest like my own boy,” Mrs. Leach said, “and so
kind to Tom. He lent him money to go to school, and
helps him a sight in his law books, and helps on the
farm, too, when he gets time, which is not often, for
Hugh is a first-rate lawyer and pleads at the bar like a
judge. I believe he’s comin’. Yes, I hear his step,”
and her face lighted up as Hugh appeared in the open
door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-morning, Mrs. Leach,” he called cheerily. “I
beg your pardon, good morning, Mrs. Thornton,” and he
bowed deferentially to the lady as he came in with a
cluster of lovely roses, which he laid in Mrs. Leach’s
lap, saying, “Here are some of Milly’s roses. They
opened this morning and I brought them to you. Shall
I give one to Mrs. Thornton?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, do; the fairest and best. I think she must be
like them, though I can’t see her,” Mrs. Leach replied,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>and selecting one of the finest, Hugh offered it to Mildred,
whose cheeks rivaled it in color, as she held it
near them to inhale its perfume.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was of the variety known as “Souvenir d’un Ami,”
and the original stock had been bought by Mrs. Leach
two or three years before with some money sent her by
Mildred, whose name she had given to the rose. This
she explained to Mildred, adding that Mr. McGregor
was so fond of the rose that he had taken a slip from
her garden and planted it under his office window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He calls it Milly’s rose,” she added, “for he and
Milly were great friends, as children. Hugh, ain’t there
something about Mis’ Thornton that makes you think
of Milly?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred’s face was scarlet, but she tried to hide it by
bending her head very low as she fastened the rose to
the bosom of her dress, while Hugh answered laughingly,
“Why, no. Milly was small and thin, and a child
when we saw her, while Mrs. Thornton is——” here
he stopped, confused and uncertain as to what he ought
to say next. But when Mildred’s eyes flashed upon him
expectantly, he added very gallantly, “Mrs. Thornton is
more like Milly’s roses.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you for the compliment, Mr. McGregor. I
will remember it and keep Milly’s rose, too,” Mildred
said, with a little dash of coquetry, and a ring in her
voice which made Hugh think of the Milly who, he supposed,
was thousands of miles away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then there was the sound of wheels stopping before
the house, and Gerard, with his apron still tied
around his neck, for he was not yet through with his
culinary duties, came to the door, saying, “Mrs. Thornton,
father is waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>“Yes, I’ll be there directly,” Mildred replied, rising
hurriedly to say good-bye, and giving her hand to her
mother, who fondled it a moment and then said to her,
“Your hands are soft as a baby’s, and there are
many rings on your fingers. I think I know how they
look, and I have felt your hair, but not your face. Tom
and Bessie say it is handsome. Would you mind my
feeling it? That’s my way of seeing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred was glad that Hugh had stepped in to the
next room and could not see her agitation, as she knelt
beside the blind woman, whose hands moved slowly
over her face and then up to her hair, where they rested
a moment as if in benediction, while she said, “You are
lovely, I am sure, and good, too, and your poor blind
mother must miss you so much. Didn’t she hate to
part with you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, oh, yes, and my heart is aching for her. Please
bless me as if you were my mother and I your daughter
Milly,” was Mildred’s sobbing reply, her tears falling
like rain as the shaking hands pressed heavily upon her
bowed head, while the plaintive voice said slowly, “God
bless you, child, and make you happy with your husband,
and comfort your poor mother while you are
away from her. Amen.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you tell Mrs. Thornton I am in a hurry?”
Mr. Thornton said to Bessie, loudly enough for Mildred
to hear, and wiping her tears away, she went out
through the side door where her husband was standing,
with a frown upon his face, caused not so much by her
delay as by the glimpse he was sure he had caught of
his son, in the kitchen, with a checked apron tied round
his neck and a big cherry stain on his forehead.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nor did the sight of his wife’s flushed cheeks and red
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>eyes help to restore his equanimity, and although he
said nothing then, Mildred felt that he was displeased,
as he helped her into the phaeton and took his seat beside
her.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>GERARD AND HIS FATHER.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Gathering up the reins and driving very slowly, he
began:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was that Gerard whom I saw tricked out as a kitchen
cook?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gerard was there. Yes,” Mildred answered, and he
continued in that cool, determined tone which means
more than words themselves, “Is he often there? Is
he interested in your sister? If he is, it must stop. I
tell you it must stop,” he added more emphatically as
his wife made no reply. “I married you because——”
he paused a moment and looked at the woman sitting at
his side in all her glowing beauty, and then went on in
a softer tone,—“because I loved you more than I loved
my pride, which, however, is so great, that it will not
quietly submit to my son’s marrying your sister.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does he intend to?” Mildred asked so coolly that
it exasperated him, and he replied, “He will not with
my consent, and he will hardly dare do so without it.
Why, he has scarcely a dollar of his own, and no business
either. More’s the pity, or he wouldn’t be capering
round a kitchen in an old woman’s apron.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it was Bessie’s,” Mildred said quietly, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>angrier than ever, her husband continued. “You told
me in Paris that your sister was engaged to Mr. McGregor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was a mistake,” Mildred said, her heart beating
heavily as she thought of all the mistake had done
for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mr. Thornton repeated, “I ventured to rally
Hugh a little this morning, and he denied the story
while something in his manner aroused a suspicion
which the sight of Gerard confirmed. What was he
doing there?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pitting cherries for Bessie,” Mildred said with provoking
calmness, and he continued, “I tell you it shall
not be. Gerard Thornton must look——” here he
stopped, not quite willing to finish the sentence, which
Milly, however, finished for him—“must look higher
than Bessie Leach?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that’s what I mean, although I might not have
said it, for I do not wish to wound you unnecessarily;
but I tell you again it must not be, and you are not to
encourage it, or encourage so much visiting between
my children and the Leach’s. Why, that girl,—Bessie,
I think is her name,—is at the Park half the time.
Heavens! What would it be if they knew who you
were! I was wise to do as I did, but I am sorry I came
here at all, and I mean to return to New York earlier
than I intended, and if necessary, sell the place. That
will break up the whole business.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To this Mildred made no reply, but sat thinking, with
a growing conviction that she now knew her husband’s
real reason for wishing to keep her identity a secret
during their stay at the Park. It was to prevent the
intimacy which he knew would ensue between her and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>her family, if they knew who she was, and with all the
strength of her will she rebelled against it. “I will
not encourage the young people, but he shall not keep
me from my mother,” she thought, and the face at which
her husband looked a little curiously as he helped her
from the phaeton, had in it an expression he did not
understand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe she’s got a good deal of the old Harry in
her after all, but I shall be firm,” he thought, as he
drove to the stable and gave his horse to the groom.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lunch was nearly over when Gerard appeared, the
cherry stains washed from his face, but showing conspicuously
on his nails and the tips of his fingers, from
which he had tried in vain to remove them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, Gerard, what have you been doing to your
hands?” Alice asked, and with an amused look at Mildred,
he replied, “Stoning cherries with them,” while
his father hastily left the table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gerard,” he said, pausing a moment in the doorway,
“Come to the library after lunch. I want to see you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir,” Gerard answered, feeling as certain then
of what was coming as he did twenty minutes later when
his father asked abruptly, “How old are you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Twenty-five last May.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Twenty-five,—yes; and been graduated three years,
and no business yet. Nothing to do but wear a kitchen
apron and stone cherries for Bessie Leach. I saw you.
I don’t like it, and as soon as we are in New York I
shall find something for you to do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At the mention of Bessie, Gerard had stiffened, for
his father’s tone was offensive. But his answer was respectful:
“I shall be glad of something to do, sir, although
I do not think myself altogether to blame for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>having been an idler so long. When I left college you
know I was in so bad health that you and the doctor
both, fearing I had inherited my mother’s malady, prescribed
perfect rest and quiet for a long time. But I
am strong now and will do anything you think best. I
prefer law, and would like to go into Mr. McGregor’s
office. I can get on faster there than in New York.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and see Bessie Leach oftener,” Mr. Thornton
began angrily. “I tell you I will not have it. The girl
is well enough and pretty enough, but I won’t have it,
and if you are getting too much interested in her, quit
her at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quit Bessie!” Gerard said. “Quit Bessie! Never!
She has promised to be my wife!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your wife!” Mr. Thornton repeated, aghast with
anger and surprise, for he never dreamed matters had
gone so far.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, my wife. I was only waiting for you to know
her better to tell you of our engagement,” Gerard replied,
and then for half an hour, Mildred, who was in
her room over the library, heard the sound of excited
voices,—Gerard’s low and determined, and his father’s
louder and quite as decided.</p>

<p class='c012'>And when the interview was over, and her husband
came up to her, he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am very sorry, my darling, because, in a way, the
trouble touches you through your sister; but you must
see that it is not a suitable match for my son. She is not
you, and has not had your advantages. She is a plain
country girl, and if Gerard persists in marrying her
he will have no help from me, either before or after my
death.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>“You mean you will disinherit him?” Mildred asked,
and he replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, just that; and I have told him so, and given
him the summer in which to make up his mind. He
has some Quixotic idea of studying law with McGregor,
which will of course keep him here after we have gone.
I don’t intend to live in a quarrel, and shall say no more
to him on the subject, or try to control his actions in
any way. If he goes with us to New York, all right;
and if he chooses to stay here, I shall know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A slight inclination of Mildred’s head was her only
reply, until her husband said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think Bessie would marry him if she knew
he was penniless?”</p>

<p class='c012'>And then she answered proudly: “I do,” and left
the room, saying to herself as she went out into the
beautiful grounds, whose beauty she did not see:
“What will he do when he hears of Alice and Tom?
Three Leaches instead of one. Poor Tom! Poor Bessie!
And I am powerless to help them.”</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>IN THE CEMETERY.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>As Mr. Thornton had said, he did not like to live in a
quarrel, and after his interview with his son, he tried to
appear just as he had done before, and when Bessie
came to the Park, as she often did, he treated her civilly,
and insensibly found himself admiring her beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>and grace, and thinking to himself, “If she had money
she might do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Upon Mildred he laid no restrictions with regard to
her intercourse with her family, feeling intuitively that
they would not be heeded. And thus she was free to
see her mother as often as she liked, and it was remarked
by the villagers that the proud mistress of
Thornton Park went more frequently to the farm house
than anywhere else. Many a morning she spent in the
pleasant room, listening while her mother talked, mostly
of Mildred, whose long silence was beginning to trouble
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is weeks since I heard from her. She said in her
last letter it might be some time before she wrote again,
but I am getting anxious,” she would say, while Mildred
comforted her with the assurance that no news
was good news, and that perhaps her daughter was intending
to surprise her by coming upon her unexpectedly
some day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am certain of it; I am something of a prophet,
and I know Milly will come,” she would say, as she
smoothed her mother’s snowy hair, or caressed her
worn face, which always lighted up with gladness when
she came, and grew sadder when she went away.</p>

<p class='c012'>By some strange coincidence, it frequently happened
that Hugh called upon Mrs. Leach when Mildred was
there, and always stopped to talk with her. But Mildred
was never quite at ease with him. Her eyes never
met his squarely, while her brilliant color came and
went as rapidly as if she were a shy school-girl confronted
with her master instead of the elegant Mrs.
Thornton, whose beauty was the theme of every
tongue, stirring even him a little, but bringing no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>thought of Mildred, of whom he sometimes spoke to
her mother. As yet Milly had found no chance to visit
her father’s and Charlie’s graves, which she knew she
could find without difficulty, as her mother had told her
of the headstones which Tom had put there in the
spring. But she was only biding her time, and one
afternoon in August, when she had been in Rocky
Point six weeks or more, she drove up the mountain
road to call upon some New Yorkers who were stopping
at the new hotel. It was late when she left the hotel,
and the full moon was just rising as she reached the
entrance to the cemetery on her return home. Calling
to the driver to let her alight, she bade him go on
and leave her, saying she preferred to walk, as the
evening was so fine. Mildred had already won the
reputation among her servants of being rather eccentric,
and thinking this one of her cranks, the man drove
on, while she went into the grounds, where the dead
were lying, the headstones gleaming white through the
clump of firs and evergreens which grew so thickly as
to conceal many of them from view, and to hide completely
the figure of a man seated in the shadow of one
of them not very far from the graves to which she was
making her way. Hugh had also been up the mountain
road on foot, and coming back had struck into the
cemetery as a shorter route home. As he was tired and
the night very warm, he sat down in an armchair
under a thick pine, whose shadow screened him from
observation, but did not prevent his outlook upon the
scene around him. He had heard the sound of wheels
stopping near the gate, but he thought no more of it
until he saw Mildred coming slowly across the yard
diagonally from the gate, holding up her skirts, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>dew was beginning to fall, and making, as it seemed to
him, for the very spot where he was sitting. At first
he did not recognize her, but when removing her hat as
if its weight oppressed her she suddenly raised her head
so that the moonlight fell upon her face, he started in surprise,
and wondered why she was there. Whose grave
had she come to find? Some one’s, evidently, for she
was looking carefully about her, and afraid to startle
her, Hugh sat still and watched, a feeling like nightmare
stealing over him as she entered the little enclosure
where the Leaches were buried. He could see the
two stones distinctly, and he could see and hear her,
too, as leaning upon the taller and bending low so that
her eyes were on a level with the lettering, she said, as
if reading. “John Leach, and Charlie; these are the
graves. Oh, father! Oh, Charlie! do you know I have
come back after so many years only to find you dead?
And I loved you so much. Oh, Charlie, my baby
brother!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here her voice was choked with sobs, and Hugh
could hear no more, but he felt as if the weight of
many tons was holding him down and making him
powerless to speak or move, had he wished to do so.
And so he sat riveted to the spot, looking at the woman
with a feeling half akin to terror and doubt, as to
whether it were her ghost, or Mildred herself weeping
over her dead. As her smothered sobs met his ear and
he thought he heard his own name, he softly whispered,
“Milly,” and stretched his arms towards her, but let
them drop again at his side and watched the strange
scene to its close. Once Mildred seemed to be praying,
for she knelt upon the grass, with her face on her
father’s grave, and he heard the word “Forgive.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>Then she arose and walked slowly back to the road,
where she was lost to view. As long as he could see the
flutter of her white dress Hugh looked after her, and
when it disappeared from sight he felt for a few moments
as if losing his consciousness, so great was the
shock upon his nervous system. Mrs. Thornton was
Mildred Leach,—the girl he knew now he had never
given up, and whose coming in the autumn he had been
looking forward to with so much pleasure. She had
come, and she was another man’s wife, and what was
worse than all she was keeping her identity from her
friends and daily living a lie. Did her husband know
it, or was he, too, deceived?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Probably,” Hugh said, with a feeling for an instant
as if he hated her for the deception. But that soon
passed away, and he tried to make himself believe that
it was a hallucination of his brain and he had not seen
her by those two graves. He would examine them and
see, for if a form of flesh and blood had been there the
long, damp grass would be trampled down in places.
It was trampled down, and in the hollow between the
graves a small, white object was lying.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Her handkerchief. She has been here,” he whispered,
as he stooped to pick it up. “If her name is on it
I shall know for sure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a name upon it, but so faintly traced that
he could not read it in the moonlight, which was now
obscured by clouds. A storm was rising, and hastening
his steps towards home he was soon in his own room and
alone to think it out. Taking the handkerchief from
his pocket, he held it to the light and read “M. F.
Thornton.” There could be no mistake. It was Mrs.
Thornton he had seen in the cemetery, but was it Mildred?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>“M. F.,” he repeated aloud, remembering suddenly
that Mildred’s name was Mildred Frances, which
would correspond with the initials.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is Milly,” he continued, “but why this deception?
Is she ashamed to have her family claim her? Ashamed
to have her husband know who she was; and did she
pass for Fanny Gardner in Europe?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Again a feeling of resentment and hatred came over
him, but passed quickly, for although he might despise
and condemn, he could not hate her. She had been
too much to him in his boyhood, and thoughts of her had
influenced every action of his life thus far. Just what
he had expected, if he had expected anything, he did not
know, but whatever it was, it was cruelly swept away.
He had lost her absolutely, for when his respect for her
was gone, she was gone forever, and laying his head
upon the table he wrestled for a few moments with his
grief and loss, as strong men sometimes wrestle with a
great and bitter pain.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If she were dead,” he said, “it would not be so hard
to bear. But to see her the beautiful woman she is,—to
know she is Mildred and makes no sign even to her
poor, blind mother, is terrible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was walking the floor now, with Milly’s handkerchief
held tightly in his hands, wondering what he
should do with it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll keep it,” he said. “It is all I have left of her
except the lock of hair and the peas she gave to me.
What a fool I was in those days,” and he laughed as he
recalled the morning when Milly threw him the pod
which he had not seen in a year.</p>

<p class='c012'>But he brought it out now, and laughed again when
he saw how hard and shriveled were both the peas.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>“Stony and hard like her. I believe I’ll throw them
away and end the tomfoolery,” he said.</p>

<p class='c012'>But he put them back in the box, which he called a
little grave, and took up next the curl of tangled hair,
comparing its color in his mind with Mrs. Thornton’s
hair, which, from its peculiar, mottled appearance, had
attracted his notice. How had she changed it, he wondered,
and then remembering to have heard of dyes, to
which silly, fashionable women sometimes resorted, he
was sure that he hated her, and putting the box away
went to bed with that thought uppermost in his mind,
but with Milly’s handkerchief folded under his pillow.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='large'>WHAT FOLLOWED.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>When Hugh awoke the next morning it was with a
confused idea that something had gone out of his life
and left it a blank, and he asked himself what it was
and why he was feeling so badly. But memory soon
brought back a recollection of the secret he held and
would hold to the end, for he had no intention of betraying
Mildred or charging her with deception, if, indeed,
he ever spoke to her again. He had no desire to do so,
he thought, and then it came to him suddenly that there
was to be a grand party at Thornton Park that night,
and that he had ordered a dress suit for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I shall not go,” he said to himself, as he made
his hurried toilet. “I could not bear to see Milly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>tricked out in the gewgaws and jewels for which she
sold herself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And firm in this resolution, he went about his usual
duties in his office, clinching his fist and setting his
teeth when several times during the day he heard Tom
Leach talking eagerly of the party, which he expected
to enjoy so much. Tom did not ask if Hugh was going,
expecting it as a matter of course, and Hugh kept his
own counsel, and was silent and moody and even cross
for him, and at about four o’clock sat down to write his
regret. Then, greatly to his surprise, he found how
much he really wanted to see Mildred once more and
study her in the new character she had assumed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall not talk with her and I don’t know that I
shall touch her hand, but I am half inclined to go,” he
thought, and tearing up his regret, he decided to wait
awhile and see; and as a result of waiting and seeing,
nine o’clock found him walking up the broad avenue to
the house, which was ablaze with light from attic to
basement, and filled with guests, who crowded the parlors
and halls and stairways, so that it was some little
time before he could fight his way to the dressing-room,
which was full of young men and old men in high collars,
low vests and swallow-tails, many of them very red
in the face and out of breath with their frantic efforts
to fit gloves a size too small to hands unused to them,
for fashionable parties like this were very rare in Rocky
Point.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred had not wished it, as she shrank from society
rather than courted it, but Gerard and Alice were anxious
for it, and Mr. Thornton willing, and under the
supervision of his children cards were sent to so many
that the proud man grew hot and cold by turns as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>thought of having his sacred precincts invaded by Tom,
Dick and Harry, and the rest of them, as he designated
the class of people whom he neither knew, nor cared to
know. But Alice and Gerard knew them, and they
were all there, Tom and Bessie with the rest, Tom by
far the handsomest young man of all the young men,
and the one most at his ease, while Bessie, in her pretty
muslin dress, with only flowers for ornament, would
have been the belle of the evening, but for the hostess,
whose brilliant beauty, heightened by the appliances of
dress, which so well became her fine figure, dazzled
every one as she stood by her husband’s side in her gown
of creamy satin and lace, with diamonds flashing on her
white neck and arms and gleaming in her hair. How
queenly she was, with no trace of the storm which had
swept over her the previous night, and Hugh, when he
descended the stairs and first caught sight of her,
stopped a few moments, and leaning against the railing,
watched her receiving her guests with a smile on her
lips and a look in her eyes which he remembered now
so well, and wondered he had not recognized before.
And as he looked there came up before him another
Milly than this one with the jewels and satin and lace,
a Milly with tangled hair and calico frock and gingham
apron, shelling her peas in the doorway and predicting
that she would some day be the mistress of Thornton
Park. She was there now, and no grand duchess born
to the purple could have filled the position better.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thornton chose well, if he only knew it,” Hugh
thought, and, mustering all his courage he at last went
forward to greet the lady. And when she offered her
hand to him he took it in spite of his determination not
to do so, and looked into her eyes, which kindled at first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>with a strange light, while in his there was an answering
gleam, so that neither would have been surprised to
have heard the names Milly and Hugh simultaneously
spoken. But no such catastrophe occurred, and after a
few commonplaces Hugh passed on and did not go near
her again until, at a comparatively early hour, when he
came to say good-night.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred had removed her glove to change the position
of a ring which cut her finger, and was about putting
it on again when Hugh came up, thinking that
at the risk of seeming rude he would not again take
the hand which had sent such a thrill through him
when earlier in the evening he held it for an instant.
But the sight of it, bare and white and soft as a
piece of satin, unnerved him and he grasped it tightly,
while he made his adieus, noting as he did so the
troubled expression of her face as she looked curiously
at him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does she suspect I know her?” he thought as he
went from the house, but not to his home.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a beautiful August night, and finding a seat in
the shrubbery where he could not be seen, he sat there
in the moonlight while one after another carriages and
people on foot went past him, and finally, as the lights
were being put out, Tom Leach came airily down the
walk, singing softly. “Oh, don’t you remember sweet
Alice, Ben Bolt? Sweet Alice, with hair so brown.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tom’s done for,” Hugh thought, little dreaming how
thoroughly he was done for in more respects than one.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='large'>LOVE VERSUS MONEY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Tom had been the last to leave the house, for he had
lingered awhile to talk to Alice, with whom he was
standing in the conservatory, partially concealed by
some tall vases and shrubs, when Mr. Thornton chanced
that way. Thinking his guests all gone and hearing
the murmur of voices, he stopped just in time to see
Tom’s arm around his daughter’s waist and to hear a
sound the meaning of which he could not mistake, as
the young man’s face came in close proximity to that of
his daughter. To say that he was astonished is saying
very little. He was horrified and disgusted, and so
indignant that his first impulse was to collar the audacious
Tom and hurl him through the window. But not
wishing a scene before the servants, he restrained himself,
and went quietly away, with much the same feeling
which prompted Cæsar to say, “<i><span lang="la">Et tu, Brute!</span></i>”
Since his interview with his son he had never mentioned
Bessie’s name to him, or raised any objection to
her coming to his house as often as she liked. But he
had watched her closely, and had been insensibly
softened by her girlish beauty and quiet grace of manner.
There was nothing of the plebeian in her appearance,
and he was beginning to think that if Gerard’s
heart were set upon her, rather than have a bitter
quarrel he might possibly consent to the marriage,
although it was not at all what he desired. The young
couple could live at the Park house, and in the spring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>he would go abroad for an indefinite length of time, and
thus separate himself and wife entirely from her family.
In Europe, with her refinement and money, Alice
would make a grand match and possibly marry
an earl, for titles, he knew, could be bought, and he
had the means to buy them. With a daughter who was
My Lady, and a son-in-law who was My Lord, he could
afford to have a Leach for his daughter-in-law, and
Gerard’s star was rising when he came so unexpectedly
upon a scene which at once changed him from a relenting
father into a hard, determined man, whom nothing
could move.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred was asleep when he went to his room, but
had she been awake he would have said nothing to her.
His wrath was reserved for his daughter, who poured
his coffee for him next morning, as Mildred had a headache,
and was not out of her bed. Gerard, too, was absent,
and the meal was a very silent, cheerless one, for
Alice felt that something was the matter and trembled
when, after it was over, her father asked her to step into
the library, as he wished to speak with her alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alice,” he began, “I want to know the meaning of
what I saw last night?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What did you see?” she asked, her heart beating
rapidly but bravely as she resolved to stand by Tom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am no spy on other people’s actions, but I was
passing the conservatory and saw Tom Leach kiss you,
and I think, yes, I’m very sure you kissed him back; at
all events you laid your head on his shoulder in a very
disreputable way, and I want to know what it means.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alice, who had some of her father’s nature, was calm
and defiant in a moment. The word disreputable had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>roused her, and her answer rang out clear and distinct,
“It means that Tom and I are engaged.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Engaged! You engaged to Tom Leach!” Mr.
Thornton exclaimed, putting as much contempt into his
voice as it was possible to do. “Engaged to Tom Leach!
Then you are no daughter of mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Thornton had never liked Tom, whose frank, assured
manner towards him was more like that of an equal
than an inferior, and for a moment he felt that he would
rather see Alice dead than married to him. Just then
Gerard came to the door, but was about to withdraw
when his father called him in and said inquiringly,
“Your sister tells me she is engaged to Tom Leach.
Did you know it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I imagined something of the kind,” was Gerard’s
reply, as he crossed over to his sister and stood
protectingly by her side, while his father, forgetting his
softened feelings towards Bessie, went on: “And
you? I gave you time to consider your choice. Have
you done so?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And it is——?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To marry Bessie,” was Gerard’s answer, while
Alice’s came with it: “And I shall marry Tom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Such opposition from both his children roused Mr.
Thornton to fury, and his look was the look of a madman,
as he said, “That is your decision. Then hear
mine. I shall disinherit you both! I can’t take away
from you the few thousands your mother left you, but I
can do as I like with my own. Now, what will you
do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Marry Bessie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Marry Tom,” came simultaneously from the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>rebels, and with the words, “So be it,” their father left
the room, and a few minutes later they saw him galloping
rapidly down the avenue in the direction of the
town.</p>

<p class='c012'>He did not return to lunch, and when he came in to
dinner he seemed very absent-minded and only volunteered
the remark that he was going to New York the
next day to see that their house was made ready for
them within a week. As Mildred’s headache was unusually
severe she had kept her bed the entire day and
knew nothing of the trouble until just at twilight, when
Alice, who felt that she must talk to some one, crept up
to her, and laying her head on the pillow beside her,
told of her father’s anger and threat and asked if she
thought he would carry it out.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” Mildred answered. “He will think better of
it, I am sure,” and Alice continued, “Not that I care
for myself, but I wanted to help Tom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you love him so much that you cannot give him
up?” Mildred asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Love him! Why, I would rather be poor and work
for my living with Tom, than have all the world without
him,” Alice replied, while the hand on her head
pressed a little heavily as she went on: “Papa is so
proud. You don’t know how contemptuously he says
<em>those Leaches</em>, as if they were too low for anything, and
all because they happen to be poor, and because——Did
I ever tell you that Bessie’s sister Mildred, who has
been so long in Europe, was once,—not exactly a servant
in our family, for she took care of me,—my little
friend, I called her, and was very fond of her. But I
suppose father does not wish Gerard and me to marry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>into her family. Are you crying?” Alice asked suddenly,
as she heard what sounded like a sob.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,—no,—I don’t know. I wish I could help you,
but I can’t,” Mildred answered, while the tears rolled
down her cheeks like rain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every word concerning her family and herself had
been like a stab to her, and she felt how bitterly she
was being punished for her deception. Once she decided
to tell Alice the truth, and might have done so if
she had not heard her husband’s step outside the door.
That broke up the conference between herself and
Alice, who immediately left the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next morning Mr. Thornton started for New
York, where he was absent for three or four days, and
when he returned he complained of a headache and
pain in all parts of his body. He had taken a severe
cold, he said, and went at once to his bed, which he
never left again, for the cold proved to be a fever, which
assumed the typhoid form, with its attendant delirium,
and for two weeks Mildred watched over and cared for
him with all the devotion of a true and loving wife.
True she had always been, and but for one memory
might have been loving, too, for Mr. Thornton had been
kind and indulgent to her, and she repaid him with
every possible care and attention. He always knew her
in his wildest fits of delirium, and would smile when she
laid her cool hand on his hot head, and sometimes whisper
her name. Gerard and Alice he never knew, although
he often talked of them, asking where they were,
and once, during a partially lucid interval, when alone
with Mildred, he said to her, “Tell the children I was
very angry, but I am sorry, and I mean to make it
right.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>“I am sure you do,” Mildred replied, little guessing
what he meant, as his mind began to wander again, and
he only said, “Yes,—all right, and you will see to it.
All right,—all right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And these were the last words he ever spoke, for on
the fourteenth day after his return from New York, he
died, with Mildred bending over him and Mildred’s
hand in his.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE WILL.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>When Mr. Thornton left Gerard and Alice after his
threat of disinheritance, he went straight to the office of
Hugh McGregor, and asking to see him alone, announced
his intention of making his will.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s time I did it,” he said with a little laugh, and
then as Hugh seated himself at his table, he dictated as
follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>To a few charitable institutions in New York he gave
a certain sum; to his children, Gerard and Alice, a
thousand dollars each, and the rest of his property he
gave unconditionally to his beloved wife, Mildred
F. Thornton.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Excuse me, Mr. Thornton,” Hugh said, looking up
curiously from the paper on which he was writing,
“isn’t this a strange thing you are doing, giving everything
to your wife, and nothing to your children. Does
she know,—does she desire it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She knows nothing, but I do. I know my own business.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>Please go on. Write what I tell you,” Mr. Thornton
answered impatiently, and without further protest
Hugh wrote the will, which was to make Mildred the
richest woman in the county, his hand trembling a little
as he wrote Mildred F., and thought to himself,
“That is Milly’s name. She did not deceive him there.
Does he know the rest?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must have three witnesses,” he said, when the
legal instrument was drawn up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tom Leach is in the next room. I saw him. He
will do for one,” Mr. Thornton said, with a grim smile,
as he thought what a ghastly joke it would be for Tom
to witness a will which cut Alice off with a mere pittance.
“Have him in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Tom was called, together with another man who
had just entered the office. A stiff bow was Mr. Thornton’s
only greeting to Tom, who listened while the
usual formula was gone through with, and then signing
his name, Thomas J. Leach, went back to his books,
with no suspicion as to what the will contained or how
it would affect him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will keep the paper myself,” Mr. Thornton said,
taking it from Hugh, with some shadowy idea in his
brain that it might be well to have it handy in case he
changed his mind and wished to destroy it.</p>

<p class='c012'>But death came too soon for that, and when he died
his will was lying among his papers in his private
drawer, where it was found by Gerard, who without
opening it, carried it to Mildred. There had been a
funeral befitting Mr. Thornton’s position and wealth,
and he had been taken to Greenwood and laid beside
his first wife, and after a few days spent in New York
the family came back to their country home, which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>preferred to the city. Bessie, Tom and Hugh met
them at the station, the heart of the latter beating rapidly
when he saw Mildred in her widow’s weeds, and
helping her alight from the train, he went with her to
her carriage, and telling her he should call in a few
days on business, bowed a little stiffly and walked
away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since drawing the will he had been growing very
hard towards Mildred, whose identity he did not believe
her husband knew, else he had not married her, and
as he went back to his office after meeting her at the
station he wondered what Gerard would think of the
will, half hoping he would contest it, and wondering
how long before something would be said of it to him.
It was not long, for the second day after his return from
New York, Gerard found it and took it to Mildred.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Father’s will,” he said, with a sinking sensation, as
if he already saw the shadow on his life.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mildred took the paper rather indifferently, but her
face blanched as she read it, and her words came slowly
and thick as she said, “Oh, Gerard, I am so sorry, but
he did not mean it to stand, and it shall not. Read it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking it from her, Gerard read with a face almost
as white as hers, but with a different expression upon
it. She was sorry and astonished, while he was resentful
and angry at the man whose dead hand was striking
him so hard. But he was too proud to show what he
really felt, and said composedly, “I am not surprised.
He threatened to disinherit us unless we gave up Bessie
and Tom, and he has done so. It’s all right. I have
something from mother and I shall be as glad to work
for Bessie as Tom will be to work for Alice. It’s not
the money I care for so much as the feeling which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>prompted the act, and, by George,” he continued, as he
glanced for the first time at the signatures, Henry Boyd,
Thomas J. Leach, Hugh McGregor, “if he didn’t get
Tom to sign Alice’s death warrant. That is the meanest
of all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>What more he would have said was cut short by the
violent fit of hysterics into which Mildred went for the
first time in her life. And she did not come out of it
easily either, but sobbed and cried convulsively all the
morning, and in the afternoon kept her room, seeing no
one but Alice, who clung to her as fondly as if she had
been her own mother. Alice had heard of the will with
a good deal of composure, for she was just the age and
temperament to think that a life of poverty, if shared
with the man she loved, was not so very hard, and besides
she had in her own right seven hundred dollars a
year, which was something, she reasoned, and she took
her loss quite philosophically, and tried to comfort Mildred,
whose distress she could not understand. Mildred
knew by the handwriting that Hugh had drawn
the will, and after passing a sleepless night she arose
early the next morning, weak in body but strong in her
resolve to right the wrong which had been done to
Gerard and Alice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going to see Mr. McGregor,” she said to them
when breakfast was over, and an hour or two later her
carriage was brought out, and the coachman ordered to
drive her to Hugh’s office and leave her there.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>MILDRED AND HUGH.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Tom was at work that morning on the farm, and as
the other clerk was taking a holiday, Hugh was alone
when he received his visitor, whose appearance there
surprised him, and at whom he looked curiously, her
face was so white and her eyes, swollen with weeping,
so unnaturally large and bright. But she was very calm,
and taking the seat he offered, and throwing back the
heavy veil whose length swept the floor as she sat, she
began at once by saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You drew my husband’s will?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I drew it,” he answered curtly, and not at all
prepared for her next question, which seemed to arraign
him as a culprit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did you do it?” and there was a ring in her
voice he could not understand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did I do it?” he repeated. “Don’t you know
that lawyers usually follow their client’s wishes in making
their wills?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but you might have dissuaded him from it.
You knew it was wrong.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You don’t like it then?” he asked, but repented the
question when he saw the effect upon her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rising to her feet and tugging at her bonnet strings
as if they choked her, she looked steadily at him and
said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t like it? What do you take me for? No, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>don’t like it, and if I had found it first, I think,—I am
sure I should have torn it to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She had her bonnet off, and was tossing it toward the
table as if its weight oppressed her. But it fell upon
the floor, where it might have lain if Hugh had not
picked it up, carefully and gingerly, as if half afraid
of this mass of crape. But it was Milly’s bonnet,
and he brushed a bit of dust from the veil, and held it
in his hand, while she pushed back her hair from her
forehead, and wiping away the drops of perspiration
standing there went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know why he made such a will?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I confess I do not. I expressed my surprise at the
time, but he was not a man to be turned from his purpose
when once his mind was made up. May <em>I</em> ask why
he did it?” Hugh said, and Mildred replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes;—he was angry with Gerard and Alice, because
of—of—Tom and Bessie Leach. The young people are
engaged and he accidentally found it out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I see;—he thought a Thornton too good to
marry a Leach. Do you share his opinion?” Hugh
asked, while the blood came surging back to Mildred’s
white face in a great red wave, but left it again, except
in two round spots which burned on either cheek.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh was torturing her cruelly, and she wrung her
hands, but did not answer his question directly. She
only said, as she took the will from her pocket and held
it towards him, “It is all right? It is legally executed?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, it is all right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And it gives everything to me to do with as I
please?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, it gives everything to you to do with as you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>please. You are a very rich woman, Mrs. Thornton,
and I congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His tone was sarcastic in the extreme, and stung
Mildred so deeply that she forgot herself, and going a
step nearer to him cried out, “Oh, Hugh, why are you
so hard upon me? Why do you hate me so? Don’t
you know who I am?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh had not expected this, for he had no idea that
Mildred would ever tell who she was, and the sound of
his name, spoken as she used to speak it when excited,
moved him strangely. He was still holding her black
bonnet, the long veil of which had become twisted
around his boot, and without answering her at once he
stooped to unwind it and then put the bonnet from him
upon the table as if it had been a barrier between him
and the woman, whose eyes were upon him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he said at last, very slowly, for he was afraid
his voice might tremble, “You are Mrs. Thornton now;
but you were Mildred Leach.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Hugh, I am so glad!” Mildred cried, as she
sank into her chair, and covering her face with her
hands, sobbed like a child, while Hugh stood looking at
her, wondering what he ought to do, or say, and wishing
she would speak first. But she did not, and at last he
said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Thornton, you have often puzzled me with a
likeness to somebody seen before I met you. But I had
no suspicion of the truth until I saw you in the cemetery
at your father’s grave. I am no eavesdropper, but was
so placed that I had to see and hear, and I knew then
that you were Mildred, come back to us, not as we
hoped you would come, but——”</p>

<p class='c012'>His voice was getting shaky, and he stopped a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>moment to recover himself. Then, taking from his side
pocket the handkerchief he had carried with him since
the night he found it, he passed it to her, saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I picked it up after you left the yard. Have you
missed it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,—no. I don’t remember,” she replied, taking
the handkerchief, and drying her eyes with it. Then,
looking up at Hugh, while the first smile she had known
since her husband died broke over her face, she continued:
“I am glad you know me; I have wanted to
tell you and mother and everybody. The deception
was terrible to me, but I had promised and must keep
my word.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then Mr. Thornton knew? You did not deceive
him?” Hugh asked, conscious of a great revulsion of
feeling towards the woman he had believed so steeped
in hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Deceive him?” Mildred said, in some surprise.
“Never,—in any single thing. I am innocent there.
Let me explain how it happened, and you will tell the
others, for I can never do it but once. I am so tired.
You don’t know how tired,” and she put her hands to
her face, which was white as marble, as she commenced
the story which the reader already knows, telling it
rapidly, blaming herself more than she deserved and
softening as much as possible her husband’s share in
the matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He was very proud, you know,” she said, “and the
Leaches were like the ground beneath his feet. But he
loved me. I am sure of that, and he was always kind
and good, and tried to make up for the burden he had
imposed upon me. Yes, my husband loved me, knowing
I was a Leach.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>“And you loved him?” Hugh asked, regretting the
words the moment they had passed his lips, and regretting
them more when he saw their effect upon Mildred.</p>

<p class='c012'>Drawing herself up, she replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whether I loved him or not does not matter to you,
or any one else. He was my husband, and I did my
duty by him, and he was satisfied. If I could have forgotten
I should have been happy, and I tell you truly I
am sorry he is dead, and if I could I’d bring him back
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was now putting on the bonnet which made her
a widow again, and made her face so deathly white that
Hugh was frightened and said to her:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forgive me, Mrs. Thornton. It was rude in me to
ask that question. Forget it, I beg of you. You are
very pale. Can I do anything for you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” she answered, faintly. “I am only tired, that’s
all, and I must get this business settled before I can
rest. I have come to give the money back to Gerard
and Alice, and you must help me do it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t quite understand you,” Hugh said. “Do you
mean to give away the fortune your husband left you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, every farthing of it. I can never use it. It
would not be right for me to keep it. He was angry
when he made that will. He did not mean it, and had
he lived he would have changed it. That was what
troubled him when he was ill and he tried to tell me
about it,” and very briefly she repeated what her husband
had said to her of his children.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I did not understand him then, but I do now. He
knew I would do right; he trusted me,” she continued,
her tears falling so fast as almost to choke her utterance.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>“But,” said Hugh, “why give it all? If Mr. Thornton
had made his will under different conditions, he
would have remembered you. Why not divide equally?
Why leave yourself penniless?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall not be penniless,” Mildred replied. “When
I was married Mr. Thornton gave me fifteen thousand
dollars for my own. This I shall keep. It will support
mother and me, for I am going back to her as soon as
all is known. And you will help me? You will tell
mother and Bessie and Tom, and everybody, and you
will be my friend, just for a little while, for the sake of
the days when we played together?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her lips were quivering and her eyes were full of
tears as she made this appeal, which no man could have
withstood, much less Hugh, who would have faced the
cannon’s mouth for her then, so great was his sympathy
for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I will do all you wish, but not to-day. The
will must be proved first, and you are too tired. I will
see to it at once, and then if you still are of the same
mind as now I am at your service. Perhaps it will be
better to say nothing for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, better so,—you—know—best—stand—by—me,—Hugh,”
Mildred said, very slowly, as she leaned back
in her chair and closed her eyes in the weary way of a
child going to sleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh thought she was going to faint, her face was so
pinched and gray, and he said, excitedly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mildred, Mildred, rouse yourself. You must not
faint here. I don’t know what to do with people who
faint. You must go home at once. Your carriage is
gone but I see a cab coming. I will call it for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Darting to the door, he signaled the cab, to which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>half led, half carried Mildred, who seemed very weak
and was shaking with cold. Rallying a little, she said
to him:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, Hugh. I’d better go home. I am getting
worse very fast and everything is black. Is it
growing dark?”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was alarming. He could not let her go alone,
and springing in beside her, Hugh bade the cabman
drive with all possible speed to the Park and then go
for a physician.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='large'>THE DENOUEMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>Nothing could have happened better for Mildred and
her cause than the long and dangerous illness which
followed that visit to Hugh’s office. It was early September
then, but the cold November rain was beating
against the windows of her room when at last she was
able to sit up and carry out her purpose. She had been
very ill, first with the fever taken from her husband,
and then with nervous prostration, harder to bear than
the fever, for then she had known nothing of what was
passing around her, or whose were the voices speaking
so lovingly to her, or whose the hands ministering to
her so tenderly, Bessie, who called her sister, and Alice,
who was scarcely less anxious and attentive than Bessie
herself. She did not even know the white-haired
woman who sat by her day after day, with her blind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>eyes turned toward the tossing, moaning, babbling
figure on the bed, whose talk was always of the past,
when she was a girl and lived at home, and bathed her
mother’s head and cooked the dinner and scolded Tom
and Bessie and kissed and petted Charlie. Of Hugh
she seldom spoke, and when she did it was in the old,
teasing way, calling him a red-haired Scotchman and
laughing at his big hands and feet. To all intents and
purposes she was the Mildred whom we first saw shelling
peas in the doorway, and the names of her husband
and Gerard and Alice never passed her lips. Every
morning and evening Hugh walked up the avenue, and
ringing the bell asked, “How is Mrs. Thornton?” Then
he would walk back again with an abstracted look upon
his face, which to a close observer would have told of
the fear tugging at his heart. The possibility that Mildred
could ever be anything to him, if she lived, did not
once enter his mind, but he did not want her to die,
and the man who had seldom prayed before, now
learned to pray earnestly for Mildred’s life, as many
others were doing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh had done his work well, and told Mildred’s
story, first to her mother, Bessie and Tom, then to
Gerard and Alice, and then to everybody, giving it, however,
a different coloring from what Mildred had done.
She had softened her husband’s part in the matter and
magnified her own, while he passed very lightly over
hers, and dwelt at length upon the pride and arrogance
of the man who, to keep her family aloof, wrung from
her a promise, given unguardedly and repented of so
bitterly. Thus the sympathy of the people was all with
Mildred, who, as the lady of Thornton Park, had won
their good opinion by her kindness and gentleness, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>gracious, familiar manner. That she was Mrs. Giles
Thornton did not harm her at all, for money and position
are a mighty power, and the interest in, and sympathy
for her were quite as great, if not greater, than
would have been the case if it were plain Mildred Leach
for whom each Sunday prayers were said in the churches
and for whom inquiries were made each day until the
glad news went through the town that the crisis was
past and she would live. Hugh was alone in his office
when the little boy who brought him the morning paper
said, as he threw it in, “Mis’ Thornton’s better. She
knows her marm, and the doctor says she’ll git well.”
Then he passed on, leaving Hugh alone with the good
news.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank God,—thank God,” he said. “I couldn’t let
Milly die,” and when a few minutes later one of his
clerks came into the front office, he heard his chief in
the next room whistling Annie Laurie, and said to
himself, with a little nod, “I guess she’s better.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It had been a very difficult task to tell Mildred’s
story to Mrs. Leach and Tom and Bessie, but Hugh
had done it so well that the shock was not as great as
he had feared it might be. As was natural, Mrs. Leach
was the most affected of the three, and within an hour
was at Mildred’s bedside, calling her Milly and daughter
and kissing the hot lips which gave back no answering
sign, for Mildred never knew her, nor any one,
until a morning in October, when, waking suddenly
from a long, refreshing sleep, she looked curiously about
her, and saw the blind woman sitting just where she
had sat for days and days and would have sat for nights
had she been permitted to do so. Now she was
partially asleep, but the words “Mother, are you here?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>roused her, and in an instant Mildred was in her
mother’s arms, begging for the pardon which was not
long withheld.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Milly, my child, how could you see me blind
and not tell me who you were?” were the only words of
reproof the mother ever uttered; then all was joy and
peace, and Mildred’s face shone with the light of a great
gladness, when Tom and Bessie came in to see her,
both very kind and both a little constrained in their
manner towards her, for neither could make it quite
seem as if she were their sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>Gerard and Alice took it more naturally, and after a
few days matters adjusted themselves, and as no word
was said of the past Mildred began to recover her
strength, which, however, came back slowly, so that it
was November before she was able to see Hugh in her
boudoir, where Tom carried her in his arms, saying, as
he put her down in her easy-chair, “Are you sure you
are strong enough for it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” she answered, eagerly. “I can’t put it off
any longer. I shall never rest until it is done. Tell
Hugh I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Tom had only a vague idea of what she wished to do,
but knew that it had some connection with her husband’s
will, the nature of which he had been told by Gerard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She’ll never let that stand a minute after she gets
well,” Tom had said, but he never guessed that she
meant to give up the whole.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh, who had been sent for that morning, came at
once, and found himself trembling in every nerve as he
followed Tom to the room where Mildred was waiting
for him. He had not seen her during her sickness, and
he was not prepared to find her so white and thin and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>still so exquisitely lovely as she looked with her eyes
so large and bright, and the smile of welcome on her
face as she gave him her hand and said, “We must
finish that business now, and then I can get well. Suppose
I had died, and the money had gone from Gerard
and Alice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it would have come back to them all the
same,” Hugh replied, sitting down beside her, and
wondering why the sight of her affected him so
strangely.</p>

<p class='c012'>But she did not give him much time to think, and
plunging at once into business, told him that she wished
to give everything to Gerard and Alice, dividing it
equally between them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know exactly what my husband had and where
it was invested,” she said, “and you must divide it to
the best of your ability, giving to each an equal share
in the Park, for I think they will both live here. I wish
them to do it, for then we shall all be near each other.
I shall live with mother and try to atone for the wrong
I have done. I have enough to keep us in comfort, and
shall not take a cent of what was left me in the will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was her decision, from which nothing could
move her, and when at last Hugh left her she had
signed away over a million of dollars and felt the richer
for it, nor could Gerard and Alice induce her to take
back any part of it after they were told what she had
done.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t worry me,” she said to them. “It seemed to
me a kind of atonement to do it, and I am so happy, and
I am sure your father would approve of it if he could
know about it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After that Mildred’s recovery was rapid, and on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>first day of the new year she went back to the farm house
to live, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties of
Gerard and Alice that she should stay with them until
Tom and Bessie came, for it was decided that the four
should, for a time at least, live together at the Park.
But Mildred was firm.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mother needs me,” she said, “and is happier when
I am with her. I can see that she is failing. I shall
not have her long, and while she lives I shall try to
make up to her for all the selfish years when I was
away, seeking my own pleasure and forgetting hers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And Mildred kept her word and was everything to
her mother, who lived to see, or rather hear, the double
wedding, which took place at St. Jude’s one morning in
September, little more than a year after Mr. Thornton’s
death. The church was full and there was scarcely a
dry eye in it as Mildred led her blind mother up the
aisle, and laid her hand upon Bessie’s arm in response
to the question, “Who giveth this woman to be married
to this man?” It was Mildred who gave Alice away,
and who three weeks later received the young people
when they came home from their wedding journey,
seeming and looking much like her old self as she did
the honors of the house where she had once been mistress,
and joining heartily in their happiness, laughingly
returned Tom’s badinage when he called her his
stepmother-in-law. Then, when the festivities were
over, she went back to her mother, whom she cared for
so tenderly that her life was prolonged for more than a
year, and the chimes in the old church belfry were ringing
for a Saviour born, when she at last died in Mildred’s
arms, with Mildred’s name upon her lips and a blessing
for the beloved daughter who had been so much to her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>The night before she died Mildred was alone with her
for several hours, and bending over her she said, “I
want to hear you say again that you forgive me for the
waywardness which kept me from you so long, and my
deception when I came back. I am so sorry, mother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forgive you?” her mother said, her blind eyes trying
to pierce the darkness and look into the face so close to
hers. “I have nothing to forgive. I understand it all,
and since you came back to me you have been the dearest
child a mother ever had. Don’t cry so, Milly,” and
the shaky hand wiped away the tears which fell so fast,
as Mildred went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know whether the saints at rest ever think
of those they have left behind; but if they do, and
father asks for me, tell him how sorry I am, and tell
Charlie how I loved him, and how much I meant to do
for him when I went away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll tell them. Don’t cry,” came faintly from the
dying woman, who said but little more until the dawn
was breaking, and she heard in the distance the sound
of the chimes ringing in the Christmas morn. Then,
lifting her head from Mildred’s arm, she cried joyfully:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The bells,—the bells,—the Christmas bells. I am
glad to go on his birthday. Good-bye, Milly. God
bless you; don’t cry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They buried her by her husband and Charlie, and
then Mildred was all alone, except for the one servant
she kept. Bessie and Alice would gladly have had her
at the Park, but she resisted all their entreaties and
gave no sign of the terrible loneliness which oppressed
her as day after day she lived her solitary life, which,
for the first week or two, was seldom enlivened by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>presence of any one except Gerard and Tom, who each
day plowed their way through the heavy drifts of snow
which were piled high above the fence tops. A terrible
storm was raging on the mountains, and Rocky Point
felt it in all its fury. The trains were stopped,—the
roads were blocked,—communication between neighbor
and neighbor was cut off, and though many would
gladly have done so, few could visit the lonely woman,
who sat all day where she could look out toward the
graves on which she knew the snow was drifting, and
who at night sat motionless by the fire, living over the
past and shrinking from the future which lay so drearily
before her.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='large'>SUNSHINE AFTER THE STORM.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It was the last day, or rather the last night of the
storm. The wind had subsided, and when the sun went
down there was in the west a tinge of red as a promise
of a fair to-morrow. But to Mildred there seemed no
to-morrow better than to-day had been, and when after
her early tea she sat down in her little sitting-room,
there came over her such a sense of dreariness and pain
as she had never before experienced. Once she thought
of her husband, who had been so kind to her, and whispered
sadly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I might have learned to love him, but he is dead
and gone; everybody is gone who cared for me. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Hugh has disappointed me,” and although she did not
realize it this thought was perhaps the saddest of all.
Hugh had disappointed her. During the two years
since her return to the farm house, she had seen but
little of him, for it was seldom that he called, and when
he did it was upon her mother, not herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>But he had not forgotten her, and there was scarcely
a waking hour of his life that she was not in his mind,
and often when he was busiest with his clients, who
were increasing rapidly, he saw in the papers he was
drawing up for them, her face as it had looked at him
when she said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Hugh, don’t you know me?” He was angry
with her then, and his heart was full of bitterness towards
her for her deception. But that was gone long
ago, and he was only biding his time to speak.</p>

<p class='c012'>“While her mother lives she will not leave her,” he
said; but her mother was dead, and he could wait no
longer. “I must be decent, and not go the very first
day after the funeral,” he thought, a little glad of the
storm which kept every one indoors.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it was over now, and wrapping his overcoat
around him, and pulling his fur cap over his ears he
went striding through the snow to the farm house,
which he reached just as Mildred was so absorbed in
her thoughts that she did not hear the door opened by
her maid, or know that he was there until he came
into the room and was standing upon the hearth rug
before her. Then, with the cry, “Oh, Hugh, is it you? I
am glad you have come. It is so lonesome,” she sprang
up and offered him her hand, while he looked at her
with a feeling of regret that he had not come before.
He did not sit down beside her, but opposite, where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>could see her as they talked on indifferent subjects,—the
storm,—the trains delayed,—the wires down,—the damage
done in town,—and the prospect of a fair day
to-morrow. Then there was silence between them and
Mildred got up and raked the fire in the grate and
brushed the hearth with a little broom in the corner,
while Hugh watched her, and when she was through
took the poker himself and attacked the fire, which was
doing very well.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I like to poke the fire,” he said, while Mildred replied,
“So do I;” and then there was silence again, until
Hugh burst out:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say, Milly, how much longer am I to wait?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wha—at?” Mildred replied, a faint flush tinging
her face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How much longer am I to wait?” he repeated;
and she answered, “Wait for what?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“For you,” and Hugh arose and went and stood over
her as he continued: “Do you know how old I am?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her face was scarlet now, but she answered laughingly,
“I am thirty. You used to be four years older
than myself, which makes you thirty-four.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he said. “As time goes I am thirty-four, but
measured by my feelings it is a hundred years since
that morning when I saw you going through the Park
gate and felt that I had lost you, as I knew I had afterwards,
and never more so than when I saw you in the
cemetery and knew who you were.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why are you reminding me of all this? Don’t you
know how it hurts?  I know you despised me then, and
must despise me now,” Mildred said, with anguish in
her tones as she, too, rose from her chair and stood
apart from him.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>“I did despise you then, it’s true,” Hugh replied,
“and tried to think I hated you, not so much for deceiving
us as for deceiving your husband, as I believed you
must have done; but I know better now. Your record
has not been stainless, Milly, and I would rather have
you as you were seventeen years ago on the summer
morning when you were a little girl of thirteen shelling
peas and prophesying that you would one day be the
mistress of Thornton Park. You have been its mistress,
and I am sorry for that, but nothing can kill my
love, which commenced in my boyhood, when you made
fun of my hands and feet and brogue and called me
freckled and awkward, and then atoned for it all by
some look in your bright eyes which said you did not
mean it. I am awkward still, but the frecks and the
brogue are gone, and I have come to ask you to be my
wife,—not to-morrow, but some time next spring, when
everything is beginning new. Will you, Milly? I will
try and make you happy, even if I have but little
money.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Hugh! What do I care for money. I hate
it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was the old Mildred who spoke in the old familiar
words, which Hugh remembered so well, but it was the
new Mildred who, when he held his arms towards her,
saying “Come,” went gladly into them, as a tired child
goes to its mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was late that night when Hugh left his promised
bride, for there was much to talk about, and all the incidents
of their childhood to be lived over again, Hugh
telling of the lock of hair and the pea-pod he had kept
with the peas, hard as bullets now, especially the
smaller one, which he called Mildred.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>“But, do you know, I really think it has recently begun
to change,” Hugh said, “and I shall not be surprised
to find it soft again——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just as I am to let you see how much I love you,”
Mildred said, as she laid her beautiful head upon his
arm, and told him of the rumor of his engagement to
Bessie, which had been the means of making her Mrs.
Thornton.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was the only secret I had from my husband,”
she said. “I told him everything else, and he took me
knowing it all, and I believe he loved me, too. He
was very kind to me,—and——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She meant to be loyal to her husband, and would
have said more, if Hugh had not stopped her mouth in
a most effective way. No man cares to hear the
woman who has just promised to marry him talk
about her dead husband, and Hugh was not an exception.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, darling, I know,” he said. “But let’s bury
the past. You are mine now; all mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hugh might be awkward and shy in many things,
but he was not at all shy or awkward in love-making
when once the ice was broken. He had waited for
Mildred seventeen years, and he meant to make the
most of her now, and he stayed so long that she at last
bade him go, and pointed to the clock just striking the
hour of midnight.</p>

<p class='c012'>No one seemed surprised when told of the engagement.
It was what everybody expected, and what
should have been long ago, and what would have been,
if Mildred had staid at home, instead of going off to
Europe. Congratulations came from every quarter and
none were more sincere than those from the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>people at the Park, who wanted to make a grand wedding.
To this Hugh did not object, for in his heart was
the shadow of a wish to see Mildred again as he saw
her that night at the party in jewels and satins and lace.
But she vetoed it at once. A widow had no business
with orange blossoms, she said, and besides that she
was too old, and Hugh was old, too, and she should be
married quietly in church, in a plain gray traveling
dress and bonnet. And she was married thus on a
lovely morning in June, when the roses were in full
bloom, and the church was full of flowers, and people,
too,—for everybody was there to see the bride, who
went in Mildred Thornton and came out Mildred McGregor.</p>

<p class='c012'>And now there is little more to tell. It is three years
since that wedding day, and Hugh and Mildred live in
the red farm house, which is scarcely a farm house now,
it has been so enlarged and changed, with its pointed
roofs and bow windows and balconies. Brook Cottage
they call it, and across the brook in the rear there is a
rustic bridge leading to the meadow, where Mr. Leach’s
cows used to feed, but which now is a garden, or
pleasure ground, not so large, but quite as pretty as the
Park, and every fine afternoon at the hour when Hugh
is expected from his office, Mildred walks through the
grounds, leading by the hand a little golden-haired boy,
whom she calls Charlie for the baby brother who died
and whom he greatly resembles. And when at last
Hugh comes, the three go back together, Hugh’s arm
around Milly’s waist and his boy upon his shoulder.
They are not rich and never will be, but they are very
happy in each other’s love, and no shadow, however
small, ever rests on Milly’s still lovely face, save when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>she recalls the mad ambition and discontent which
came so near wrecking her life.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Park three children play, Giles and Fanny,
who belong to the Thorntons, and a second Mildred
Leach, who belongs to Tom and Alice.</p>

<p class='c012'>One picture more, and then we leave them forever
near the spot where we first saw them. Gerard and
Bessie,—Alice and Tom,—have come to the cottage at
the close of a warm July afternoon, and are grouped
around the door, where Mildred sits, with the sunlight
falling on her hair, a bunch of sweet peas pinned upon
her bosom, and the light of a great joy in her eyes as
she watches Hugh swinging the four children in a
hammock, and says to Bessie “I never thought I could
be as happy as I am now. God has been very good to
me.”</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
